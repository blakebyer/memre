    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental disease characterized by altered cortical network excitability. Recent genetic studies have identified deep layer V cortical pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex as central to autism pathophysiology, yet the cortical circuits, plasticity mechanisms and molecular signalling pathways involved remain poorly understood. Layer V pyramidal neurons consist of two main types with distinct functional roles: intratelencephalic neurons, which respond to low-frequency stimulation and project within the cortex and striatum, and pyramidal tract neurons, which are tuned to theta-frequency inputs and convey information to subcortical structures. Determining which of these two neuron types is more critical to autism pathophysiology and whether disruptions in their synaptic connectivity or intrinsic excitability contribute to autism-related dysfunctions would significantly advance our understanding of the disorder. Integrins, a family of cell adhesion molecules, are vital for neuronal function. The gene encoding β3 integrin (ITGB3) is genetically linked to autism spectrum disorder, with rare mutations identified in affected individuals, while Itgb3 knockout mice exhibit autism-like behaviours, including impaired social memory and increased grooming. However, it remains unclear why loss of β3 integrin is associated with autism spectrum disorder, how it disrupts cortical circuits, and which plasticity mechanisms and molecular pathways are involved.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here, we demonstrate that β3 integrin selectively regulates the excitability of pyramidal tract neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. Using electrophysiology, proteomics and molecular approaches, we show that β3 integrin regulates the gain, adaptation and precision of action potential discharge by controlling the surface expression of Ca2+-activated SK2 channels. Genetic ablation of Itgb3 impaired intrinsic excitability and SK2 channel function in pyramidal tract neurons, with no effects in intratelencephalic neurons. Furthermore, we identified Tau, a protein traditionally linked to neurodegenerative diseases, as part of the SK2 channel interactome. Proteomic analyses revealed altered protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Tau in Itgb3 knockout mice, while protein kinase A inhibition restored SK2 channel currents, thereby connecting phosphorylation changes to excitability deficits.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our findings expand the current mechanistic framework linking signalling pathway dysfunctions to cortical excitability deficits, highlighting the dysregulation of pyramidal tract neuron excitability as a core feature of autism pathophysiology and demonstrating the involvement of β3 integrin, SK2 channels, Tau and PKA in this process. Because pyramidal tract neurons serve as final integrators of cortical computations before relaying information outside the cortex, their impaired excitability may disrupt communication with subcortical targets, contributing to the complex pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder.</jats:p>",

The extent to which this deficit occurs after unilateral left hemisphere damage and the critical left hemisphere areas involved are not well defined.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We tested acoustic-phonetic perception in 73 individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke and performed multivariate lesion-symptom mapping incorporating controls for non-specific task confounds, pure tone hearing loss, response bias and lesion size. Separate analyses examined place of articulation, manner of articulation, voicing and vowel discriminations. Overlap of the lesion map with transcallosal pathways linking left and right temporal lobes was examined using a probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography map of these pathways obtained from a healthy control cohort.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Compared to an age- and education-matched control sample, 18% of the patients had impaired acoustic-phonetic perception overall, with 44% impaired on voicing, 26% on manner, 15% on place and 14% on vowel discrimination. Lesion-symptom mapping revealed the most critical areas to be the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) and adjacent medial belt cortex, the acoustic radiation and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). There were notable differences between lesion correlates for the different types of discrimination, with place discrimination linked to medial TTG, vowel discrimination to lateral TTG and planum temporale, manner discrimination to posterior planum temporale and voicing discrimination to pSTS. Overlap of the main lesion map with transcallosal temporal lobe pathways was minor but included a deep white matter component at the base of the middle and inferior temporal gyri. The extent of overlap between individual lesions and the transcallosal pathway map was not correlated with acoustic-phonetic perception.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results add further evidence that acoustic-phonetic impairments, particularly impairments of voicing perception, are relatively common after unilateral left temporal lobe damage, and they clarify the lesion correlates of these deficits. Differences between the lesion maps for the discrimination types likely reflect differential reliance on spectral versus temporal analysis for these discriminations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) is a long-range white matter tract that connects the prefrontal cortex with parietal, posterior temporal and occipital cortices. First identified in the 19th century through the pioneering studies of Mayo and Meynert using blunt dissection, its anatomy and function remain contentious topics. Structurally, its projections are well documented in human blunt dissection and tractography literature, yet its existence has been questioned by tract-tracing studies in macaques. Functionally, while traditional results from direct white matter stimulation during awake surgery suggested a contribution to language, recent evidence from stimulation and lesion data may indicate a broader role in executive control, extending to attention, motor cognition, memory, reading, emotion recognition and theory of mind.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This review begins by examining anatomical evidence suggesting that the IFOF evolved in non-human primates to connect temporal and occipital cortices to prefrontal regions involved in context-dependent selection of visual features for action. We then integrate developmental, electrophysiological, functional and anatomical evidence for the human IFOF to propose it has a similar role in manipulation of visual features in our species—particularly when inhibition of overriding but task-irrelevant stimuli is required to prioritize a second, task-relevant stimulus.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Next, we introduce a graded model in which dorsal (orbitofrontal, superior and middle frontal to precuneal, angular and supero-occipital projections) and ventral (inferior frontal to posterotemporal, basal temporal and infero-occipital) projections of the IFOF support perceptual or conceptual control of visual representations for action, respectively. Leveraging this model, we address controversies in the current literature regarding language, motor cognition, attention and emotion under the unifying view of cognitive control. Finally, we discuss surgical implications for this model and its impact on predicting and preventing neurological deficits in neurosurgery.</jats:p>",

This neural highway, first discovered in the 19th century, continues to be a topic of fascination in neuroscience. Recent insights delve into its evolutionary development and functional roles, shedding light on its significance in cognition and potential implications for brain surgery. As we uncover more about the IFOF, we deepen our understanding of the brain's intricate network and its impact on human behavior and neurology. 🧩🔍\n\n#Neuroscience #BrainResearch #WhiteMatter #BrainConnections #Cognition #Neuroanatomy #BrainFunction #IFOF #ScienceExploration",

          "description": "Reconstructed ontogeny of the <i>Lophosteus</i> marginal jawbone relative to the development of the lateral line. Block diagrams in antero-external view, aligned so that the biting margin maintains a fixed position (note that this causes the older parts of the bone to move away from the biting margin and rotate anticlockwise during growth). The founder ridges and the ornament-like tooth TR7-7 mark the labial rotation and drift of the tooth rows. (A) The initial odontodes are formed as founder ridges. (B) Isolated dermal odontodes and teeth are added sequentially in opposite direction, respectively attaining a stellate and conical morphology. The teeth are shed semi-basally, establishing replacement tooth positions. (C) Teeth are cyclically replaced at the positions set up by the first-generation teeth; the second-generation odontodes invade the oral domain lingually and form around the lateral line canal labially. Lines of resorption around the lateral line canal indicates bone remodeling (see Figure 4—figure supplement 6). Note, the replacement of teeth and the overgrowth of odontodes may have commenced before the addition of the ultimate first-generation teeth. (D) The ventral extension of the lateral line canal partially resorbs the second-generation odontodes at its ventral border; more tooth rows are overgrown\nby the third-generation odontodes after being rotated to the face; new tooth positions are inserted to compensate the embedded labial tooth positions. Curved arrows, examples of the adding or shedding of teeth or dermal odontodes. The buried part of teeth and dermal odontodes, the embedded resorption surfaces and bone mineralized at earlier stages become increasingly grey. The lateral line is represented by neuromasts and epithelial cells. The size and number of neuromasts is schematic and only represents their presence. Perspective view. Scale bar not applicable.",
