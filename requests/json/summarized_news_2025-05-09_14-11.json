Two Neuroscience Theories Go Head-to-Head\nTwo leading theories of consciousness went head-to-head—and the results may change how neuroscientists study one of the oldest questions about existence\nBy\nAllison Parshall\nedited by\nJeanna Bryner\nfergregory/Getty Images\nWhere in the brain does\nconsciousness\noriginate? Theories abound, but neuroscientists still haven’t coalesced around one explanation, largely because it’s such a\nhard question to probe\nwith the scientific method. Unlike other phenomena studied by science, consciousness cannot be observed externally. “I observe your behavior. I observe your brain, if I do an intracranial EEG [electroencephalography] study. But I don’t ever observe your experience,” says Robert Chis-Ciure, a postdoctoral researcher studying consciousness at the University of Sussex in England.\nScientists have landed on two leading theories to explain how consciousness emerges: integrated information theory, or IIT, and\nglobal neuronal workspace theory\n, or GNWT. These frameworks couldn’t be more different—they rest on different assumptions, draw from different fields of science and may even define consciousness in different ways, explains Anil K. Seth, a consciousness researcher at the University of Sussex.\nTo compare them directly, researchers organized a group of 12 laboratories called the Cogitate Consortium to test the theories’ predictions against each other in a large brain-imaging study. The result, published in full on Wednesday in\nNature,\nwas effectively a draw and\nraised far more questions than it answered\n. The preliminary findings were posted to the preprint server bioRxiv in 2023. And only a few months later,\na group of scholars publicly called IIT “pseudoscience”\nand attempted to excise it from the field. As the dust settles, leading consciousness researchers say that the Cogitate results point to a way forward for understanding how consciousness arises—no matter what theory eventually comes out on top.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n“We all are very good at constructing castles in the sky” with abstract ideas, says Chis-Ciure, who was not involved in the new study. “But with data, you make those more grounded.”\nWhat Are the Two Consciousness Theories?\nThe contenders in this face-off are, in some ways, direct inverses of each other. “The two theories are very different creatures,” says Christof Koch, a cognitive scientist at the Allen Institute in Seattle and a co-author of the Cogitate results. Global neuronal workspace theory takes what psychologists have learned about the brain and cognition to suggest that consciousness is a sort of stage. When a particular stimulus enters our conscious awareness, such as an annoying buzzing sound or a bright color, it gets thrust onto the stage and spotlighted.\nIntegrated information theory, Koch’s preferred framework, instead starts by defining what consciousness is more abstractly and then imagines what properties a system would need to have in order to experience it. Consciousness, IIT argues, arises from processing information—the more information, the more conscious a system can be, roughly speaking.\nWhile these explanations are both quite abstract, the theories can be used to make testable predictions about what happens in the brain when someone consciously perceives something. For example, GNWT says that frontal regions of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex turn the “spotlight” on information when one first becomes conscious of it, a phenomenon called ignition that should be detectable in an imaging study when an individual has a conscious experience. And IIT says that conscious experience would emerge more toward the back of the brain, where nearby networks of neurons are more closely connected, Koch explains.\nThe Cogitate Consortium project, which began in 2018, set out to pit the predictions against each other at multiple labs run by theory-neutral teams. “These were people that did not have skin in the game,” explains Chis-Ciure. They used three different brain-imaging techniques to observe the brains of 256 participants—a very large sample size for a neuroscience study—while those participants completed the same visual tasks, which involved rotating faces and letters. These types of tasks require conscious experience.\nThe results challenge both theories because neither’s predictions were fully borne out by the data. For instance, GNWT predicted that electrodes in the prefrontal cortex would detect a signal when a stimulus disappeared and was removed from the mental stage of consciousness, but that was largely absent ",
    "summary": "where does consciousness come from? 🧠✨ two major neuroscience theories—integrated information theory (iit) and global neuronal workspace theory (gnwt)—recently faced off in a groundbreaking multi-lab brain imaging study. while iit suggests consciousness emerges from complex information processing (mainly in the back of the brain), gnwt sees it as a spotlight on the “stage” of awareness in the brain’s frontal regions. the study, led by the cogitate consortium, put both theories to the test using diverse brain scans and visual tasks. the result? neither theory fully matched the data, leaving the mystery unsolved but pushing the field forward. this head-to-head highlights how challenging it is to scientifically probe consciousness, yet also shows the value of rigorous, collaborative research. as neuroscience advances, these findings remind us that the quest to understand consciousness is still wide open—and more exciting than ever.\n\n#neuroscience #consciousness #brainresearch #sciencenews"

But the magazine—and the world of science journalism in general—also looks radically different today than it did in, say, 1990.\nThat’s when today’s guest first started working at\nSciAm\n. Until his retirement earlier this month Gary Stix served as\nScientific American\n’s senior editor of mind and brain topics. Given that Gary worked at\nSciAm\nlonger than I’ve been alive, we thought it would be cool to pick his brain about how his coverage areas of technology and neuroscience have evolved over the last 35 years.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nGary, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us today.\nGary Stix:\nWell, thank you for having me.\nFeltman:\nSo when did you actually start at\nScientific American\n?\nStix:\nI started in June of 1990. I was here largely before the Internet as we know it now. We’d take the floppy disk, we’d create a printout, and that was used by the copy desk to actually edit the articles we were doing. And there always are corrections ...\nFeltman:\n[Laughs] Sure.\nStix:\nTo a manuscript; one copy editor would have to read to the other the changes. So it was a very different world than the one we have now.\nTo put that in context there was an Internet—it was used by the government and certain academic facilities—but the time of waking up in the morning and looking at your device was far, far away.\nFeltman:\nRight, yeah [laughs]. And you started out covering technologies, is that correct?\nStix:\nYes,\nScientific American\nwas in—its absolute pinnacle of its heyday was the whole period after the launch of Sputnik ...\nFeltman:\nMm.\nStix:\nAnd the recognition that the U.S. had to up its game in science and technology. I can’t tell you how many times that, through the years, I’ve met people who’ve said, “I have every issue of\nScientific American\ngoing back for 40 years. They’re all in my garage.”\nFeltman:\n[Laughs]\nStix:\nSo one of the things I covered was the emergence of the Internet—or it was actually a question of how electronic communications would provide things like entertainment, news, shopping. And [laughs] at the time, it, it’s so funny to think of this now, AOL was thought of as perhaps the leading contender for being able to do that—given the position of AOL today as a very, very minor player, that is absolutely hilarious—but the peer connections of the Internet and the gradual evolution of thinking about how that peer-to-peer aspect could enable everyone in the world to communicate.\nI actually have a small excerpt from one of the articles that I wrote at the time ...\nFeltman:\nOh, cool.\nStix:\nCalled “Domesticating Cyberspace,” and it said, “The migration to the Internet by universities, government agencies, community organizations and even business electronic mail users is seen as stirrings of mass appeal for electronic networking beyond the automated teller machine.”\nSo the automated teller machine was thought of as high-tech, and very advanced technology was thought of as e-mail ...\nFeltman:\nMm.\nStix:\nWhich is so ironic given everything that’s happened in the decades since then.\nFeltman:\nYeah, no, I remember being at a science museum somewhere in—it was maybe, at the earliest, 1994, maybe 1995, and they had a little exhibit where they were like, “This computer is connected to a computer in France. You can talk to France with this computer.” [Laughs] And it was like, “Whoa.” [Laughs]\nStix:\nYeah, yeah.\nFeltman:\nSo yeah, things have, have changed a lot.\nWhat are some other things that, you know, fascinated you in the ’90s in, in terms of technology coverage?\nStix:\nWell, I wrote a bunch of those trends articles, and they covered a range of technology topics, ranging from maglev trains to the need for the—an upgrade of the air traffic control system, which still needs upgrading, even after all of these ensuing decades. And I even did a story on designer concrete.\nIn the late 1990s I started a column on intellectual property ...\nFeltman:\nMm.\nStix:\nExploring questions like how to patent a gene and looked at the development of new technologies from the original idea all the way to the market.

Humans are wired to reduce uncertainty, even if it means choosing a known negative outcome over an\nambiguous one. This is because the anticipation of an unpredictable threat keeps the\nnervous system\non high alert, which is biologically and emotionally taxing.\nThis phenomenon is sometimes called \"\nuncertainty aversion\n\" and has evolutionary roots: better to prepare for a known danger than remain paralyzed by the unknown.\nWe are wired to seek predictability, control, and clarity. Our ancient survival circuitry kicks in when the world feels unstable—our amygdala, the brain's threat detector, fires up, sending us into fight, flight, freeze, or appease responses. In times like these, when so much feels in flux both personally and collectively, we are reminded of how disorienting it is to live without solid ground beneath our feet.\nYet, this is precisely where profound growth and healing can occur.\nOne of the voices that has helped me navigate these turbulent waters is that of Tibetan Buddhist teacher Pema Chödrön. Her teachings on \"groundlessness\" have deeply informed my personal practice and my clinical work as a psychotherapist and neuroscientist. She speaks to a truth that aligns remarkably well with what we understand about the brain and emotional\nresilience\n: that the path forward is not found in avoiding discomfort but in turning toward it with\nopenness\nand compassion.\n\"The truth is that things don't really get solved. They come together and they fall apart,\" she writes.\nLet that sink in for a moment. This is a radical notion in a culture obsessed with solutions and tidy endings. It invites us to stop bracing against life's messiness and instead become intimate with it.\nThe Neuroscience of Groundlessness\nFrom a neuroscience perspective, uncertainty triggers our limbic system, particularly the amygdala, which interprets ambiguity as a potential threat. This, in turn, can suppress our prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for\nexecutive functions\nlike planning,\ndecision-making\n, and\nemotional regulation\n. In other words, the more uncertain we feel, the less able we are to respond thoughtfully.\nBut here's the good news: we can rewire this response.\nWhen we meet uncertainty with\nmindfulness\nand curiosity, we engage different neural pathways. We shift from\nfear\n-based reactivity to a state of open inquiry. This activates the brain's SEEKING system—a\ncore emotional system\nidentified by affective neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp. The SEEKING system drives exploration, learning, and the pursuit of meaning. It's where our vitality lives.\nCuriosity, then, becomes a biological antidote to fear.\nPracticing Presence in the Unknown\nIn\ntherapy\nsessions, I often invite clients to \"stay with the feeling\" instead of trying to fix or avoid it. This is not about marinating in pain or discomfort indefinitely, but about developing the capacity to witness our inner experience with kindness. Pema calls this staying present with \"the soft spot\"—that tender, vulnerable place inside us that is often exposed during times of upheaval.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Stress?\nTake our Burnout Test\nFind a therapist to overcome stress\nTo sit with uncertainty is to say: Even though I don't know what comes next, I trust that I can meet this moment with compassion.\nThis is not easy. Our brains scream for escape routes. But over time, with gentle practice, we can expand our window of tolerance. We become more resilient, more adaptable, and paradoxically, more at ease in the face of not knowing.\nA Practice to Try\nWhen you're in the grip of uncertainty, try this simple practice inspired by both neuroscience and Buddhist mindfulness:\nPause.\nNotice your impulse to act, fix, or flee.\nBreathe.\nSlow, deep breaths help regulate your nervous system.\nName it.\nAcknowledge what you're feeling: fear, confusion,\nanger\n,\ngrief\n.\nStay.\nCan you be with this feeling, just for a few breaths, without judgment?\nSoften.\nBring a sense of kindness to yourself. This is hard, a",
    "summary": "uncertainty is hardwired into our brains as a threat, activating stress and survival instincts 🧠. but neuroscience shows we can change our response: instead of fighting or fleeing the unknown, we can meet it with mindfulness and curiosity. this shift engages the brain’s seeking system, sparking exploration and resilience rather than fear. buddhist wisdom echoes this—growth happens when we stay open to life’s messiness, not by seeking constant control. next time you feel anxious about the unknown, try pausing, breathing, naming your emotion, staying with it, and softening with self-kindness. over time, these small acts help rewire your brain, making you more adaptable and compassionate, even in chaos. in today’s fast-changing world, embracing uncertainty may be the most powerful tool for emotional strength and well-being.\n\n#neuroscience #uncertainty #mindfulness #resilience #mentalhealth"

Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives,” Kilgard said. “In this case, we had 100% loss of diagnosis. It’s very promising.”\nProlonged exposure therapy — a component of traditional PTSD treatment — is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted in a safe and supportive environment, that involves individuals gradually confronting thoughts, memories and situations they have avoided since experiencing a trauma.\nIn the study, scientists paired this therapy with concurrent delivery of short bursts of stimulation of the vagus nerve via a small device implanted in a participant’s neck.\nAfter a standard 12-session therapy course, assessments were performed four times during the six months after its conclusion. Benefits persisted during that time for all nine participants.\nThe study is the largest clinical trial to date using an implanted device for the treatment of PTSD, Kilgard said.\nPioneering work by TxBDC researchers has demonstrated previously that VNS paired with physical rehabilitation can accelerate neuroplasticity — the rewiring of areas of the brain.\nTheir 13-year effort to treat a wide variety of conditions using VNS has resulted in approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.\n“The common theme in our VNS work is that we’re taking therapies that show potential, like prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD, and making them work better,” he said.\nThe National Center for PTSD, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, estimates that 5% of adults in the U.S. have post-traumatic stress disorder in any given year, and that women are twice as likely to develop PTSD at some point in their life.\nMany PTSD patients fail to respond to therapy or pharmacological intervention, or experience intolerable side effects or relapse, leaving them with no viable prospect for remission.\nKilgard said that PTSD patients are not only found among military veterans, but also among average citizens who have faced traumatic events.\n“When you hear PTSD, you may picture a combat zone, but it’s much more prevalent than that,” he said.\n“It can stem from any event that inspires fear of death or bodily injury, or death of a loved one.”\nCo-corresponding author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and director of preclinical research at the TxBDC, has been a part of the VNS project since its earliest studies.\n“It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience to see this technology evolve from early discovery experiments in the lab to clinical benefits in patients,” Hays said. “This whole process truly highlights the value of team-based science.”\nMore than a decade ago, Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, began to design an innovative i",

Now, researchers from Japan have developed a computational model revealing new insights into the unique droplet-inside-droplet structures that memory-related proteins form at synapses. They discovered that the shape characteristics of a memory-related protein are crucial for the formation of these structures, which could shed light on the nature of various neurological disorders.\nOur brain's remarkable ability to form and store memories has long fascinated scientists, yet most of the microscopic mechanisms behind memory and learning processes remain a mystery. Recent research points to the importance of biochemical reactions occurring at postsynaptic densities -- specialized areas where neurons connect and communicate. These tiny junctions between brain cells are now thought to be crucial sites where proteins need to organize in specific ways to facilitate learning and memory formation.\nMore specifically, a 2021 study revealed that memory-related proteins can bind together to form droplet-like structures at postsynaptic densities. What makes these structures particularly intriguing is their unique \"droplet-inside-droplet\" organization, which scientists believe may be fundamental to how our brains create lasting memories. However, understanding exactly how and why such complex protein arrangements form has remained a significant challenge in neuroscience.\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team led by Researcher Vikas Pandey from the International Center for Brain Science (ICBS), Fujita Health University, Japan, has developed an innovative computational model that reproduces these intricate protein structures. Their paper, published online in\nCell Reports\non April 07, 2025, explores the mechanisms behind the formation of multilayered protein condensates. The study was co-authored by Dr. Tomohisa Hosokawa and Dr. Yasunori Hayashi from the Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, and Dr. Hidetoshi Urakubo from ICBS, Fujita Health University.\nThe researchers focused on four proteins found at synapses, with special attention to Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) -- a protein particularly abundant in postsynaptic densities. Using computational modeling techniques, they simulated how these proteins interact and organize themselves under various conditions. Their model successfully reproduced the formation of the above-mentioned \"droplet-inside-droplet\" structures observed in earlier experiments. Through simulations and detailed analyses of the physical forces and chemical interactions involved, the research team shed light on a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS); it involves proteins spontaneously organizing into condensates without membranes that sometimes resemble the organelles found inside cells.\nCrucially, the researchers found that the distinctive \"droplet-inside-droplet\" structure appears as a result of competitive binding between the proteins and is significantly influenced by the shape of CaMKII, specifically its high valency (number of binding sites) and short linker length. These shape-related properties of CaMKII result in low surface tension and slow diffusion, allowing the protein condensates to remain stable for extended periods. This stability enables the sustained activation of downstream signaling pathways necessary for synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis for learning and memory. \"\nOur results revealed new structure-function relationships for CaMKII as a synaptic memory unit. This is the first systematic and mechanistic study investigating the divergent structure of protein-regulated multiphase condensates\n,\" highlights Dr. Pandey.\nThese findings could pave the way toward a better understanding of the possible mechanisms of memory formation in humans. However, the long-term implications of this research extend well beyon",
    "summary": "new research has used advanced computer models to reveal how memory-related proteins organize into “droplet-inside-droplet” structures at synapses—the tiny junctions where neurons connect. 🧠 these unique shapes, especially those formed by the protein CaMKII, are key to how our brains store memories. understanding these microscopic protein behaviors could unlock new clues about learning, memory, and even neurological disorders. as neuroscience moves forward, these insights are shaping the future of brain health and disease research.\n\n#neuroscience #memory #brainhealth #proteinstructure #sciencenews"

But now, for the first time, scientists say they’ve broken out of that familiar spectrum and into a new world of color. In a paper published on Friday in\nScience Advances,\nresearchers detail how they used a precise laser setup to stimulate the\nretinas\nof five participants,\nmaking them the first humans\nto see a color beyond our visual range: an impossibly saturated bluish green.\nOur retinas contain three types of cone cells, photoreceptors that detect the wavelengths of light. S cones pick up relatively short wavelengths, which we see as blue. M cones react to medium wavelengths, which we see as green. And L cones are triggered by long wavelengths, which we see as red. These red, green and blue signals travel to the brain, where they’re combined into the\nfull-color vision\nwe experience.\nBut these three cone types handle overlapping ranges of light: the light that activates M cones will also activate either S cones or L cones. “There’s no light in the world that can activate only the M cone cells because, if they are being activated, for sure one or both other types get activated as well,” says Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nNg and his research team wanted to try getting around that fundamental limitation, so they developed a technicolor technique they call “Oz.”\n“The name comes from\nthe Wizard of Oz,\nwhere there’s a journey to the Emerald City, where things look the most dazzling green you’ve ever seen,” Ng explains. On their own expedition, the researchers used lasers to precisely deliver tiny doses of light to select cone cells in the human eye. First, they mapped a portion of the retina to identify each cone cell as either an S, M or L cone. Then, using the laser, they delivered light only to M cone cells.\nIt wasn’t exactly a comfortable setup. “This is not a consumer-oriented device, right? This was a basic visual science and neuroscience project,” Ng says. In fact, the researchers experimented on themselves: three of the five participants were co-authors of the study. The two others were colleagues from the University of Washington, who were unaware of the purpose of the research.\nNg himself was one of the participants. He entered a darkened lab and sat at a table. “There were lasers, mirrors, deformable mirrors, modulators, light detectors,” Ng says. There, he had to bite down hard on a bar to keep his head and eyes still. As the laser shone into his retina, he perceived a tiny square of light, roughly the size of a thumbnail viewed at arm’s distance. In that square, he glimpsed the Emerald City: a color the researchers have named “olo.”\nRipley Cleghorn\nWhat, exactly, did olo look like? Ng describes it as “blue-green with unprecedented saturation”—a perception the human brain conjured up in response to a signal it had never before received from the eye. The closest thing to olo that can be displayed on a computer screen is teal, or the color represented by the hexadecimal code #00ffcc, Ng says. If you want to try envisioning olo, take that teal as the starting point: Imagine that you are adjusting the latter on a computer. You keep the hue itself steady but gradually increase the saturation. At some point, you reach a limit of what your screen can show you. You keep increasing the saturation past what you can find in the natural world until you reach the limit of saturation perceptible by humans—resulting in what you’d see from a laser pointer that emitted almost entirely teal light. Olo lies even further than that.\nTo check if what the participants saw as olo really was a color beyond humans’ standard visual range, the researchers completed color-matching experiments in which they could compare olo with a teal laser and adjust the color’s saturation by adding or subtracting white light. All participants found that if they added white light to olo, desaturating it, the new color would match the laser, confirming that olo lies beyond the normal human range of color vision.\n“It’s a fascinating study, a truly groundbreaking advance in the ability to understand the photoreceptor mech",
    "summary": "scientists have just unlocked a new chapter in how we see the world 🌈—they’ve discovered a color that’s literally impossible for most humans to perceive. using ultra-precise lasers, researchers stimulated only the “m” cone cells in the eye (those that normally help us see green), creating a mind-bending bluish-green hue they’ve named “olo.” this color lives outside the spectrum our eyes can usually access, pushing the boundaries of human perception and neuroscience. only five people have ever seen olo, and it required a high-tech lab setup—teal on your screen is as close as you’ll get without lasering your retinas. this breakthrough is a powerful reminder that our brains and senses still hold mysteries, and that neuroscience continues to reveal new dimensions to our everyday reality. what colors might we uncover next? 👁️✨\n\n#neuroscience #colorvision #science #discovery #perception"

Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives,\" Kilgard said. \"In this case, we had 100% loss of diagnosis. It's very promising.\"\nProlonged exposure therapy -- a component of traditional PTSD treatment -- is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted in a safe and supportive environment, that involves individuals gradually confronting thoughts, memories and situations they have avoided since experiencing a trauma.\nIn the study, scientists paired this therapy with concurrent delivery of short bursts of stimulation of the vagus nerve via a small device implanted in a participant's neck. After a standard 12-session therapy course, assessments were performed four times during the six months after its conclusion. Benefits persisted during that time for all nine participants.\nThe study is the largest clinical trial to date using an implanted device for the treatment of PTSD, Kilgard said.\nPioneering work by TxBDC researchers has demonstrated previously that VNS paired with physical rehabilitation can accelerate neuroplasticity -- the rewiring of areas of the brain. Their 13-year effort to treat a wide variety of conditions using VNS has resulted in approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.\n\"The common theme in our VNS work is that we're taking therapies that show potential, like prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD, and making them work better,\" he said.\nThe National Center for PTSD, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, estimates that 5% of adults in the U.S. have post-traumatic stress disorder in any given year, and that women are twice as likely to develop PTSD at some point in their life. Many PTSD patients fail to respond to therapy or pharmacological intervention, or experience intolerable side effects or relapse, leaving them with no viable prospect for remission.\nKilgard said that PTSD patients are not only found among military veterans, but also among average citizens who have faced traumatic events.\n\"When you hear PTSD, you may picture a combat zone, but it's much more prevalent than that,\" he said. \"It can stem from any event that inspires fear of death or bodily injury, or death of a loved one.\"\nCo-corresponding author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and director of preclinical research at the TxBDC, has been a part of the VNS project since its earliest studies.\n\"It's been an incredibly rewarding experience to see this technology evolve from early discovery experiments in the lab to clinical benefits in patients,\" Hays said. \"This whole process truly highlights the value of team-based science.\"\nMore than a decade ago, Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, began to design an innovative implantable VNS device that was much smaller and less expensive than devices already on the market. The most recent wireless version of the device is about the size of a dime.\n\"The technology we have is above and beyond anything else that's out there. The device is about 50 times smaller than our version from just three years ago,\" he said. \"The 49 people in the Dallas area with our devices have a combined 100 years of experience with it implanted. There have been no issues; the devices are all still functioning. And they don't interfere with typical medical care; you can have an MRI, a CT scan or an ultrasound.\"\nThe next step in the PTSD research -- a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot study -- is ong",
    "summary": "groundbreaking research reveals that pairing traditional ptsd therapy with vagus nerve stimulation (vns) can lead to long-lasting relief—even for those who haven’t responded to other treatments. in a recent clinical trial, patients who received vns alongside therapy remained symptom-free for up to six months after treatment. this innovative approach uses a tiny device to deliver gentle electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, boosting the brain’s ability to rewire itself and heal from trauma. as ptsd affects millions worldwide, these findings offer real hope for more effective, lasting recovery. this study marks a significant step forward in neuroscience, showing how technology and therapy together can transform mental health care. 🌱✨\n\n#neuroscience #ptsd #mentalhealth #innovation #vagusnerve #healingjourney"

It has been suggested that this might lead to so-called digital\ndementia\n—that\ndepending on digital technology\nthroughout our life might detract from cognitive functioning in our later years.\nBut new research indicates this hypothesis\ndoesn’t appear to be true\n, at least for the generation of adults who first routinely used smartphones, computers and the Internet—and who are now reaching the age when cognitive impairment often starts to appear. In a paper published on Monday in\nNature Human Behaviour,\nresearchers analyzed 57 studies of digital technology use and cognitive function in more than 400,000 older adults across the world. They found that people in the “digital pioneer” generation who engaged more with digital technology did not have higher rates of cognitive impairment. In fact, technology use was associated with\nlower\nrates of cognitive decline. Yet the nature of the apparent relationship between these factors remains unclear.\nOne reason some researchers worried about “digital dementia” was previous research that linked television viewing, a passive activity, with\nnegative outcomes\nsuch as an increased risk of\nAlzheimer’s disease\n. On the surface, most computer or smartphone screentime might seem similarly passive, says the new paper’s co-author Michael Scullin, a neuroscience researcher at Baylor University. But “for this group of middle-aged and older adults, [phones and computers] have been used for mentally stimulating activities and for social connections,” such as solving puzzles, engaging with the news, chatting with friends, or using reminders and alarms to help with daily activities.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nScullin and his co-author Jared Benge, a neuropsychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, gathered large studies that tracked cognitive and other health outcomes—and that also included information on participants’ everyday technology use. The authors identified 57 studies and rated them for the quality of their evidence, based on sample size, methods, and more. In analyzing the studies’ results, the researchers found technology use pointed to a reduced risk of cognitive decline. This outcome could not be solely explained by demographic, socioeconomic, health or other lifestyle factors in isolation.\nA possibility that using digital technology could potentially help stave off cognitive decline aligns with the cognitive reserve theory, or the idea that the brain can work around damage from neurodegenerative diseases by\nfinding alternate ways to complete tasks\n. This theory, based on a\n1988 study\nin which individuals with no dementia symptoms were found to have Alzheimer’s-like changes in their brain, holds that engaging with complex mental activities may lead to better cognitive well-being in older age.\nBut it’s also possible that the reverse is true: instead of technology use staving off dementia, early experiences of cognitive decline could decrease older adults’ likelihood of engaging with technology in the first place. Or an unknown third variable could be affecting both technology use and cognitive decline. “Correlation is not causation,” Benge stresses.\n“I was not especially surprised by the results, but I was surprised by how clear and consistent they were,” says neuroscientist Sam Gilbert of University College London, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This study provides a robust challenge to the pervasive fears about ‘digital dementia’ and highlights the potential of technology as a tool for cognitive enrichment,” says Chiara Scarampi, a neuroscientist at the University of Geneva, who also was not involved with the study.\n“‘Digital dementia’ has always felt like a catchy but overstated concept to me,” she adds. “Cognitive offloading—using tools like reminders or GPS—is not inherently harmful. In fact, it can free up cognitive resources for more complex tasks.”\nSubscribe to\nScientific American\nto learn and share the most exciting discoveries, innovations and ideas shaping our world today.\nSubscription Plans\nGive a Gift Subscript",
    "summary": "new research is challenging the myth of “digital dementia”—the idea that using smartphones and computers leads to cognitive decline in older adults. a large analysis of over 400,000 people found that those who regularly use digital tech actually have a lower risk of dementia, possibly because these activities keep the brain engaged and connected. while it’s still unclear if tech use directly protects the brain or if healthier brains are simply more likely to use tech, this study highlights that staying digitally active may support cognitive health as we age. as neuroscience continues to explore how our brains adapt, these findings suggest that tech can be a tool for enrichment, not harm. 🧠💡\n\n#neuroscience #brainhealth #aging #digitalwellness #scienceupdate"

As professor of computational and theoretical neuroscience at Princeton University, he mainly works with other people’s data to construct models of the brain’s decision-making process. So when a collaborator came to him a few years ago with confusing data from mice that had performed a complex decision-making task in the lab, Daw says his best advice was just to fit the findings to the tried-and-true model of reward prediction error (RPE).\nThat model relies on the idea that dopaminergic activity in the midbrain reflects discrepancies between expected and received rewards.\nDaw\n’s collaborator,\nBen Engelhard\n, had measured the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice as they were deciding how to navigate a virtual environment. And although the virtual environment was more complex than what a mouse usually experiences in the real world, an RPE-based model should have held, Daw assumed.\n“It was obvious to me that there was this very simple story that was going to explain his data,” Daw says.\nBut it didn’t. The neurons exhibited a wide range of responses, with some activated by visual cues and others by movement or cognitive tasks. The classic RPE model, it turned out, could not explain such heterogeneity. Daw, Engelhard and their colleagues published the\nfindings\nin 2019.\nThat was a wake-up call, Daw says, particularly after he watched videos of what the mice actually experienced in the maze. “It’s just so much more complicated, and high dimensional, and richer” than expected, he says. The idea that this richness could be reduced to such a simple model seems ludicrous now, he adds. “I was just so blinded.”\nTo reconcile the RPE theory with reality, Daw and his colleagues have developed a different model, which they\npublished\nin July, that puts a new spin on the original theory: Dopamine neurons still encode errors in predictions, but instead of all the dopamine neurons responding to every kind of cue, each cell has its own narrow window on the world that accounts for the heterogeneity the researchers observed.\nTheirs is not the first push to reframe the RPE theory in recent years. As more advanced tools have enabled researchers to collect more complex data than before, the field has gained fresh insights into how the dopamine system operates, how diverse the population of dopaminergic cells is, and how dopamine release seems to happen even in the absence of reward. And as a result, the theory of RPE, which was developed out of simpler data, is increasingly being put to the test.\n“I find these studies add interesting aspects to the models one can derive from the empirical data, and I do want to encourage the work,” says\nWolfram Schultz\n, professor of neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, who helped to develop the original RPE theory.\nSome researchers, such as Daw and the authors of a recent perspective\narticle\non RPE refinements, say that the new discoveries just point to adjustments that need to be made to the original model. Others, including\nErin Calipari\n, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Addiction Research at Vanderbilt University, say they are less convinced of the RPE model’s ability to explain behavior—and they have recently levied both direct and indirect challenges to RPE, suggesting that dopamine signals salience, or novelty, or retrospective learning, rather than errors in reward prediction.\n“There is nothing about the [original] data that is wrong—it’s that you start to get more information, as tools get better, that changes your interpretation of exactly what would be happening,” Calipari says.\nThe stakes seem small in some ways: A better model can produce slight advantages here or there in predicting the activity of dopamine neurons. But the downstream effects—what it suggests about the brain, where it points for future research and how it shapes translational work—are large. On top of that, the debate over when to tweak or trash a theory reflects how",
    "summary": "scientists are rethinking what dopamine really does in the brain. For decades, the reward prediction error (RPE) theory suggested dopamine simply signals the gap between expected and actual rewards. But as neuroscience tools and experiments grow more complex, researchers are seeing a much richer and more varied picture. New findings reveal dopamine neurons respond to far more than just reward—they’re activated by movement, visual cues, novelty, and cognitive tasks, and each neuron may have its own unique “window” on the world.\n\nThis shift is sparking debate: Should the classic RPE model be updated, or scrapped altogether? Some believe tweaks are enough, while others argue dopamine’s role is broader—signaling motivation, salience, or even learning from the past. As the field evolves, these insights are reshaping our understanding of how the brain drives behavior and how we approach brain disorders.\n\nthe science of reward is changing—dopamine isn’t just about pleasure, but a complex messenger shaping every decision and experience 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #dopamine #brainresearch #reward #scienceupdate"

Through experiments combining brain scans and a virtual environment the researchers dubbed Tiny Town, they showed that five-year-olds have the brain system that supports map-based navigation.\nThe journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published the finding, the first neural evidence that this cognitive ability is in place in such young children.\n\"While large-scale navigation abilities certainly continue to develop throughout childhood, our findings show that the underlying neural system is established remarkably early,\" says Yaelan Jung, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Emory's Department of Psychology.\n\"Rather than taking a decade or more, map-based navigation is underway in half that time,\" adds Daniel Dilks, associate professor of psychology and senior author of the study. \"Five-year-olds have the brain system enabling them to find their way around a tiny, virtual town. They not only know that the ice cream store in the mountain region is different than the ice cream store in the lake region, they know how to navigate the streets to get to each of them.\"\nMapping the visual brain\nDilks is at the forefront of identifying specific functions of the visual cortex related to face, place and object processing -- how we recognize and get around our world. He's also pioneering methods to study the timeline for the development of these functions, from infancy to adulthood.\n\"Two fundamental questions in neuroscience,\" he explains, \"are how knowledge is organized in the brain and the origins of that knowledge. In other words, what knowledge are you born with and how does knowledge develop as you grow?\"\nThe technology of fMRI offers a window into those questions. The harmless, noninvasive technique uses a giant magnet to scan the brain and record the magnetic properties in blood. It measures heightened blood flow to a brain region, indicating that region is more active.\nIn adult studies during the past decade, the Dilks lab has showed that three scene-selective regions in the brain perform separate, non-overlapping, tasks. The parahippocampal place area (PPA) allows us to recognize places and cluster them into categories. The retrosplenial complex (RSC) maps the places into their proper locations within a larger space, allowing us to navigate from one place to another. The occipital place area (OPA) allows us to walk around our immediate surroundings, not bumping into boundaries or other obstacles.\n\"We can't fix most neurological problems right now,\" Dilks says. \"But by continuing to learn more about how the brain develops and functions normally, we keep moving closer to being able to repair it when something goes wrong.\"\nWalking navigation versus map-based navigation\nIn 2024, Dilks and Jung discovered that the brain system for walking through the immediate environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles, does not look adultlike until age 8.\n\"It seems counterintuitive,\" Dilks says. \"Most children can walk before the age of two. And yet the brain system helping you walk around your immediate surroundings doesn't start appearing adultlike until relatively late.\"\nDilks and Jung had a theory that the seemingly more complex and sophisticated abilities of map-based navigation develop earlier. They noted that even before they can walk well, children are carried from room-to-room and taken in strollers from place-to-place, allowing them to essentially build up a map of their surroundings.\nFor the current paper, they created experimental protocols for five-year-olds to test their theory.\nThey started with a virtual town known as Neuralville, developed by the Dilks lab for an adult study. It consists of eight buildings laid out on streets surrounding a town square and oriented by the four cardinal directions.\nIn tests with five-year-old participants registered with the Emory Child Study Center, Jung soon learned that Neuralville was a bit too complicated for them to navigate. She simplified the paradigm, turning it into a triangle, and called it Tiny Town. Instead of cardinal directions, distinctive landscapes delineate each point of the triangle, including the mountain corner, the tree corner and the lake corner.\nShe created six structures for Tiny Town, including two each of categories generally of int",

The results were surprising.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nA new study by psychologists has shed light on the way lip size could influence perceptions of facial attractiveness.\nLed by Professor David Alais in the School of Psychology at the University of Sydney, researchers have uncovered gender-specific biases and the potential influence of cosmetic procedures on Western perceptions of beauty.\nThe study used digitally manipulated images to alter lip size on both male- and female-appearing faces and asked participants to rate their attractiveness. The results showed a difference in preference for lip size that was dependent on recent experience and some surprising gender differences.\nThe findings are published today in the\nProceedings of the Royal Society B\n.\nMain findings\nOverall findings:\nPooling all observers, the highest ratings were for male images with thinner lips and female images with plumper lips.\nGendered preferences:\nFemale participants showed an even stronger preference for plumper lips when viewing images of female faces, while male participants preferred female faces with unaltered lips. This suggests that attractiveness judgments are shaped by the observer's own gender.\nThe adaptation effect:\nExposure to a face with lips altered to be plumper or thinner influenced subsequent attractiveness judgements of new faces. Exposure to plump lips led to future higher ratings for faces with plump lips, and exposure to thin lips led to future higher ratings for thin-lipped faces. Psychologists have seen this adaptation effect influence visual preference for a range of stimuli, from art to food preference.\nLips in isolation:\nInterestingly, the study found that adaptation to lips alone, without the context of the whole face, also produced shifts in attractiveness ratings, suggesting that lip size is encoded by the brain as a distinct feature, separate from the overall facial structure.\nImplications for body image\nProfessor Alais, who specialises in visual perception and cognitive neuroscience, said these findings have potential implications for the growing popularity of cosmetic procedures, particularly lip augmentation. Not only do the results indicate that lip plumping may primarily appeal to women, but also that exposure to faces with artificially enhanced lip sizes could lead to \"lip dysmorphia,\" where one's perception of what is considered attractive shifts towards a new plumper norm.\n\"Our research highlights the subjective nature of beauty and the powerful influence of social and cultural factors,\" Professor Alais said. \"As cosmetic procedures become more accessible, it's crucial to understand how these interventions can shape our perceptions and potentially lead to unrealistic beauty standards.\"\nMethod and results\nProfessor Alais, working with Associate Professor Jessica Taubert at the University of Queensland, recruited 32 students -- 16 female and 16 male -- for the experiments. The participants were shown images of a digitally manipulated proxy image for a human face with alterations around a 'norm'.\nOverall, participants were shown 168 faces, representing seven lip sizes with lips thinner or plumper than the norm. Participants were given 1.25s to register how relatively attractive they found each image.\nWhile the general results show participants thought slightly plumper lips were more attractive on the female face and slightly thinner lips more attractive on a male face, when disaggregated by gender, men preferred a female face with natural lip size image, with women preferring plumper lips.\nNext steps\n\"While not directly part of this study, the results suggest a complex interplay between social conditioning and gender,\" Professor Alais said.\n\"This study provides valuable insights into how people respond to facial features based on immediately prior as well as acculturated visual experience,\" he said. \"Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of cosmetic procedures on body image and the potential for visual adaptation to contribute to body dysmorphia.\"\nRELATED TOPICS\nMind & Brain\nGender Difference\nPsychology\nPerception\nSocial Psychology\nRelationships\nIntelligence\nSpirituality\nNutrition Research\nRELATED TERMS\nSocial psychology\nPsychologist\nAggression\nFacial symmetry\nCognitive psychology\nPsychiatry\nPanic attack\nPerfectionism (psychology)\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nUniversity of Sydney\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nRelated Multimed",

In 1979, famed molecular biologist, Francis Crick, stated that it would be \"[impossible] to create an exact wiring diagram for a cubic millimeter of brain tissue and the way all its neurons are firing.\" But during the last seven years, a global team of more than 150 neuroscientists and researchers has brought that closer to reality.\nThe Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) Project has built the most detailed wiring diagram of a mammalian brain to date. Today, scientists published the scientific findings (see\nhttps://www.nature.com/collections/bdigiaicbd\n) from this massive data resource in a collection of ten studies in the\nNature\nfamily of journals. The wiring diagram and its data, freely available through the MICrONS Explorer, are 1.6 petabytes in size (equivalent to 22 years of non-stop HD video), and offer never-before-seen insight into brain function and organization of the visual system.\n\"The MICrONS advances published in this special issue of\nNature\nare a watershed moment for neuroscience, comparable to the Human Genome Project in their transformative potential,\" said David A. Markowitz, Ph.D., former IARPA program manager who coordinated this work.\n\"IARPA's moonshot investment in the MICrONS program has shattered previous technological limitations, creating the first platform to study the relationship between neural structure and function at scales necessary to understand intelligence. This achievement validates our focused research approach and sets the stage for future scaling to the whole brain level.\"\nScientists at Baylor College of Medicine began by using specialized microscopes to record the brain activity from a one cubic millimeter portion of a mouse's visual cortex as the animal watched various movies and YouTube clips. Afterwards, Allen Institute researchers took that same cubic millimeter of the brain and sliced it into more than 25,000 layers, each 1/400th the width of a human hair, and used an array of electron microscopes to take high-resolution pictures of each slice. Finally, another team at Princeton University used artificial intelligence and machine learning to reconstruct the cells and connections into a 3D volume. Combined with the recordings of brain activity, the result is the largest wiring diagram and functional map of the brain to date, containing more than 200,000 cells, four kilometers of axons (the branches that reach out to other cells) and 523 million synapses (the connection points between cells).\n\"Inside that tiny speck is an entire architecture like an exquisite forest,\" said Clay Reid, Ph.D., senior investigator and one of the early founders of electron microscopy connectomics who brought this area of science to the Allen Institute 13 years ago. \"It has all sorts of rules of connections that we knew from various parts of neuroscience, and within the reconstruction itself, we can test the old theories and hope to find new things that no one has ever seen before.\"\nA New Look at Brain Function and Organization\nThe findings from the studies reveal new cell types, characteristics, organizational and functional principles, and a new way to classify cells. Among the most surprising findings was the discovery of a new principle of inhibition within the brain. Scientists previously thought of inhibitory cells -- those that suppress neural activity -- as a simple force that dampens the action of other cells. However, researchers discovered a far more sophisticated level of communication: Inhibitory cells are not random in their actions; instead, they are highly selective about which excitatory cells they target, creating a network-wide system of coordination and cooperation. Some inhibitory cells work together, suppressing multiple excitatory cells, while others are more precise, targeting only specific types.\n\"This is the future in many ways,\" explained Andreas Tolias, Ph.D., one of the lead scientists who worked on this project at both Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. \"MICrONS will stand as a landmark where we build brain foundation models that span many levels of analysis, beginning from the behavioral level to th",

The prevailing theory has suggested additional genetic factors may play a role.\nTo address this question, a new study from Northwestern Medicine used modern technology, called CRISPR interference, to systematically examine every gene in the human genome. The scientists identified a new set of genes that contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease, which opens the door to previously untapped drug targets for treating PD.\nMore than 10 million people worldwide are living with PD, the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.\nThe study was published April 10 in the journal\nScience\n.\n\"Our study reveals that a combination of genetic factors plays a role in the manifestation of diseases like Parkinson's disease, which means that therapeutic targeting of several key pathways will have to be considered for such disorders,\" said corresponding author Dr. Dimitri Krainc, chair of Davee department of neurology and director of the Feinberg Neuroscience Institute at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\"It also is possible to identify such genetic factors in susceptible individuals by studying tens of thousands of patients, which is challenging and costly,\" Krainc said. \"Instead, we used a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to silence each of the protein-coding human genes in cells and identified those important for PD pathogenesis.\"\nVariants in Commander genes contribute to PD\nThe study discovered that a group of 16 proteins, called Commander, comes together to play a previously unrecognized role in delivering specific proteins to the lysosome, a part of the cell that acts like a recycling center, breaking down waste materials, old cell parts and other unwanted substances.\nPrevious research has found the greatest risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is carrying a pathogenic variant in the\nGBA1\ngene. These harmful variants reduce the activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is important for cells' recycling process in lysosomes. However, it has been unknown why some people who carry pathogenic GBA1 variants develop PD whereas others do not. To address this, the current study identified Commander complex genes and corresponding proteins that modulate GCase activity specifically in the lysosome. By examining the genomes from two independent cohorts (the UK Biobank and AMP-PD), the scientists found loss-of-function variants in Commander genes in people with PD compared to those without it.\n\"This suggests that loss-of-function variants in these genes increase Parkinson's disease risk,\" Krainc said.\nNew drug targets to improve lysosomal function\nLysosomal dysfunction -- or when a cell's recycling system malfunctions -- is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. This study reveals that the Commander complex plays an important role in maintaining lysosomal function, suggesting that drugs that help Commander proteins work better might also improve the cell's recycling system.\nFuture research will need to determine the extent to which the Commander complex plays a role in other neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit lysosomal dysfunction.\n\"If Commander dysfunction is observed in these individuals, drugs that target Commander could hold broader therapeutic potential for treating disorders with lysosomal dysfunction,\" Krainc said. \"In this context, Commander-targeting drugs could also complement other PD treatments, such as therapies aiming to increase lysosomal GCase activity, as potential combinatorial therapy.\"\nOther Northwestern authors include first co-authors postdoctoral fellow Georgia Minakaki and research assistant profess",

It blends sentimental longing for a cherished past and the bittersweet realization that one can never fully return to that time. Psychologists have long puzzled over why humans experience this intricate emotion and its possible functions: Does nostalgia trap us in the past, or does it function as a psychological resource that could lead us to the future?\nPeople can feel nostalgic about many things, but research shows that nostalgic narratives often\ncenter on others\n, especially those who hold significant meaning in our lives. We may feel nostalgic for childhood family gatherings, shared experiences with school friends or holidays spent with loved ones. Even when we are nostalgic about objects, such as childhood toys or the aroma of a particular meal, those feelings often feature moments we shared with the people around us.\nThe social tones of nostalgia are well known to researchers, but its effect on social relationships is less understood. In previous research, my colleagues and I found that, during the COVID pandemic, people often turned to music that\ntriggered nostalgic feelings\nwhen they felt lonely and lacked social contact while in lockdown. Similar patterns appeared in the selection of other leisure activities, such as classic TV shows, traditional board games and\nother familiar favorites\n. People seem to find solace in nostalgia when they are disconnected from others.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nWe wondered whether nostalgia might be triggered to help people regulate their social connections and networks. So we conducted a series of studies examining whether nostalgia brings not only temporary\nfeelings of connectedness\nbut also motivates people to seek, and eventually achieve, connection with close others.\nIn our first two studies, we surveyed 449 undergraduate students from the University at Buffalo and an additional 396 U.S. adults recruited through a nationwide survey panel. Participants completed a scale measuring “nostalgia proneness,” which assessed how frequently they feel nostalgic and how important they find nostalgic experiences. They also reported the number of people in their “closest networks” (friends and loved ones it would be hard to imagine life without), “close networks” (also close but not part of the inner circle) and “less close networks” (still important but not as tightly connected).\nParticipants who were highly prone to nostalgia had more people in their innermost friendship circle. Further, this tendency was linked to their motivation to maintain their social network. Nostalgic people seem to be more driven to invest resources in keeping their relationships over time. This effect holds true regardless of a person’s personality traits, such as extroversion, agreeableness or emotional stability.\nPast research shows that there are\ntwo major motivations\nsurrounding our social networks: one to meet new people and the other to strengthen our existing connections. We discovered that people who are highly nostalgia-prone score high on both types of social motivations, but the effects were stronger for bolstering their existing network.\nIt was not clear from the data whether nostalgia\ncaused\nchanges in behavior and motivation, however. Perhaps having big social networks and lots of old friends simply makes people more nostalgic. In a third study, we set out to understand that possibility by analyzing data from the Netherlands that tracked the same group of 520 participants from 2013 to 2019, recording things like their nostalgia proneness and social network size.\nMuch like in the American surveys, people with a greater tendency for nostalgia in the Dutch group had a larger number of close social ties, that is, people whom participants reported they could talk to about important matters in their lives. But the exciting finding, for us, had to do with change over time. Nostalgia measured at an earlier time point predicted a larger network of close ties later. And by contrast, having a larger close social network was not a predictor of more nostalgic tendencies later. That suggests nostalgia could be driving changes in social behavior that promote connection.\nThe Dutch data also showed that close social networks tend to shrink with age. As people grow older, they are more likely to\nlose touch and cut ties\nfor varied reasons, including major life events such as moving to a new city or becoming a parent. In line with that, we found that the close socia",
    "summary": "nostalgia isn’t just a longing for the past—it’s a powerful tool that helps us keep our friendships alive. recent neuroscience research reveals that when we feel nostalgic, especially about shared moments with friends or family, it motivates us to reconnect and invest in our closest relationships. during tough times like the pandemic, people turned to nostalgic music, shows, and games to feel less lonely. studies show that those who often feel nostalgic tend to have bigger, stronger inner circles—not just because they have more friends, but because nostalgia actually drives them to nurture those bonds. as we age and life changes, nostalgia helps us hold onto meaningful connections, reminding us of the importance of community. these findings highlight nostalgia’s role in social brain function, showing how our memories shape the way we connect today. 🧠💫\n\n#neuroscience #nostalgia #friendship #mentalhealth #socialconnections"

How was this at all possible?\nThis most unexpected recovery led to a shift in Feldenkrais's thinking and ongoing neuroscience research\nThis process led to the idea that the brain, body, thoughts and movements are interconnected.\nHow was this at all possible?\nSource: Microsoft Copilot / Microsoft\nHow Was This at All Possible?\nMoshé Feldenkrais had two injured knees (one long-term and one short-term), both of which resulted in ongoing pain. After walking home with these injuries and without first aid, Feldenkrais went to bed to rest and hopefully sleep. When he woke up, the injury and pain in his newly injured leg had “disappeared!” How was this at all possible?\nTo try to explain this unexpected circumstance, Feldenkrais put forward the following body and brain hypothesis. “When one side of the brain is inhibited, often the other takes over its functions. The inhibition of the motor cortex maps for the good leg caused the motor cortex map of his damaged leg to ‘fire up’ whatever muscle he had left, so it could be more useful” (Doidge, 2015, 165).\nThis most unexpected recovery led Feldenkrais to conclude that his physical condition was not the only factor influencing how his body felt, moved, and functioned. This motivated him to continue his pursuit of knowledge in neuroscience and further reading.\nThe Connection Between the Brain and the Body\nThe purpose was to examine the connection between the brain and body. This neuroscience study by Feldenkrais ultimately led him to conclude that “the unity of mind and body is an objective reality. They are not merely parts somehow related to each other, but an indispensable whole in their functioning” (Doidge, 2015, p. 167).\nBy integrating his judo training, studies, and teaching with his neuroscience research and personal experiences (particularly those related to his injuries), Feldenkrais decided to write and publish his book\nBody and Mature Behavior\n. This work, along with his neuroscience knowledge and judo experiences, led him to establish what he called the “11 core principles of life.”\nThe Journey Towards Developing the 11 Core Principles of the Feldenkrais Method\nWhile training in and teaching judo, Feldenkrais observed that although the students were instructed in correct judo technique, whenever something unexpected happened, they reverted to reflexive movements aimed at self-protection that did not specifically resemble judo techniques.\nThis informed Feldenkrais that this self-protective movement was, according to his neuroscience studies, the\nnatural defensive circuitry of that specific brain map\n. With this in mind, Feldenkrais decided that instead of trying to change this natural self-protective movement (along with its supporting brain map), he would utilize these instinctive movements of self-protection to design a judo technique aligned with these reflexive actions.\nShift in Thinking\nThis shift in thinking led Feldenkrais to teach and coach a specific judo-inspired technique, where he informed his students that when attacked, they should accept and follow their instinctive tendency to block their face. With that movement noted and studied, Feldenkrais proceeded to develop a judo-focused technique and movement that became, according to Feldenkrais, an even “better block” (Doidge, 2015, p. 163).\nAccording to Feldenkrais, this represented a “better blocking” movement because it utilized the instinctive reacting reflex condition, which seemed to be part of the judo player’s instinctual and reflective movement state. At the same time, this “new” judo-inspired technique and movement needed to be integrated into the natural state of the “judo brain map of blocking skill” in question; otherwise, the movement would not exist.\nNeuroscience Essential Reads\nThe 100-year-old Brain Disease That Could Come Back\nToday’s Been a Heck of a Week!\nThe Mind and Body Are a Single Unit\nThis process led Feldenkrais to argue that the mind and body are a single unit existing as a whole, meaning that everything is connected; therefore, all thoughts and\nmovements\nare interconnected and interrelated. This principle informed Feldenkrais that when it came to movement, “no part of the body can be moved without others being affected” (Doidge, 2015, p. 166). Therefore, Feldenkrais argued, it was “impossible to move one part [of the body] however slightly, and not influence all the others” (Doidge, 2015, p. 166).\nTherefore, according to Doidge, what th",
    "summary": "can the brain help the body heal? moshé feldenkrais’ improbable recovery from knee injuries sparked a groundbreaking idea: the mind and body aren’t just connected—they’re a single, unified system. 🧠✨ his experience showed that pain and movement aren’t just about the body, but also how the brain adapts and responds. feldenkrais’ insights, blending neuroscience and movement, led him to develop methods that use our natural reflexes and instincts for better healing and learning. today, neuroscience continues to validate this mind-body unity, showing how our thoughts, habits, and movements are deeply intertwined. every move you make is a conversation between brain and body—change one, and you change the other. #neuroscience #mindbody #feldenkrais #healing #movement"

A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit. The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.\n“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author\nSusumu Tonegawa\n, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.\nIn 2020\nTonegawa’s lab showed\nthat learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region. When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2. When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread. Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.\nIn the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories. The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nshow that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).\n“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm. “We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery. This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”\nForgetting fear\nThe VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them. The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect. They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.\nAn edited version of a figure from the research shows the ventral tegmental area, highlighting dopamine-associated neurons in green and one that connects to the posterior amygdala (magnified in inset) in red.\nThe circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine? The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.\nDopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment. On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet. On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes. On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.\nThe dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early momen",
    "summary": "new research from mit neuroscientists reveals how our brains “unlearn” fear: when a threat disappears, dopamine released between the ventral tegmental area and the amygdala acts as an ‘all-clear’ signal, helping us extinguish fear memories. this process not only calms anxiety but also feels rewarding, thanks to dopamine’s role in activating specific amygdala neurons linked to both fear extinction and positive feelings. understanding this pathway could lead to better treatments for fear-related disorders like ptsd, highlighting how the brain’s reward circuits help us let go of old fears and embrace safety. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #dopamine #fear #mentalhealth #ptsd #brainresearch"

They can be charming, act assertively and articulate visions that may inspire confidence, especially in times of uncertainty. This can attract many followers. In 1931 Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis,\nechoed this belief\n: “[Narcissists] impress others as being ‘personalities’; they are especially suited to act as a support for others, to take on the role of leaders and to give a fresh stimulus to cultural development or to damage the established state of affairs.”\nBut\nnarcissists\nfamously have a dark side as well that includes unethical, autocratic and aggressive behavior. They often stifle collaboration and dismiss expert advice. Given those trade-offs, why do narcissists often end up in positions of leadership, and who is drawn to them? My colleague Barbara Nevicka, an organizational psychologist at the University of Amsterdam, and I set up the Childhood Leadership Study to investigate this question in childhood, when narcissistic leadership first emerges. We conducted fine-grained assessments of leadership behavior in 332 children aged seven to 14—and found patterns both in the preference for these leaders and in the relationships that leaders and followers form.\nNarcissism is a\npersonality trait\ncharacterized by feelings of grandiosity, a sense of entitlement, and a craving for respect and admiration. It’s part of what psychologists call the\n“dark triad”\nof personality traits—along with\npsychopathy\nand\nMachiavellianism\n, or cold, strategic manipulation for personal gain. In adulthood, narcissism may develop into a narcissistic personality disorder. About\n6 percent of people in the U.S. meet the criteria for this disorder\nat some point in their lives, though they may not receive a formal diagnosis. Our research focuses on children with above-average narcissism levels because narcissistic personality disorder is usually not formally diagnosed before adulthood.\nOn supporting science journalism\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by\nsubscribing\n. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\nThe personality trait of narcissism develops in childhood\nand can be measured from middle childhood, around age seven. Although some degree of narcissism is\ntypical in children this age\n, markedly higher levels compared with peers may signal a narcissistic personality. Middle childhood is also when leadership tendencies take shape and become increasingly evident. From age nine, children spend about\n75 percent of their free time at school\nin groups of three or more peers, allowing them to form leader-follower relationships. Leadership on the playground, then, provides a blueprint for leadership in politics and beyond.\nOur study shows that narcissistic children often\nemerge as leaders\nin their classrooms. When we asked children to nominate classmates who they perceived to be leaders, kids in 96 percent of the classrooms tended to pick children with more narcissistic tendencies. It seems that narcissistic children embody the qualities their peers associate with leadership.\nBut are narcissistic children better leaders? We assigned children to three-person groups and randomly designated one child as the leader to find out. The groups did a collaborative task, with the leader responsible for the decision-making process. Unsurprisingly, more narcissistic children perceived themselves as better leaders. Yet compared with their less narcissistic peers, they did not lead their group to perform better, exhibit stronger leadership (such as by delegating tasks) or receive higher ratings from their group members.\nThis finding ties in with research among adults. A\nmeta-analysis by Emily Grijalva\n, an organizational psychologist at the University at Buffalo, shows that narcissistic adults tend to emerge as leaders but don’t excel in those roles.\nWe suspected that narcissistic traits in leaders are more attractive to some people than others. So we\nzoomed in on children with low self-esteem\n—those who feel unsatisfied with themselves and are often shy and withdrawn. We found that when followers with low self-esteem had a narcissistic leader, they perceived the leader as more effective and were more likely to endorse them for future leadership roles than did their peers with higher self-esteem. What’s more, they felt more included in the group, perceived greater group cohesion, felt better about themselves and were more inclusive toward others when they had a narcissistic leader.\nWhy might children (or f",
    "summary": "why do narcissists often become leaders, even as kids? new research shows that children with higher narcissistic traits—those craving admiration and projecting confidence—are often chosen as leaders by their peers. while these kids see themselves as great leaders, their actual leadership performance isn’t better than others. interestingly, children with lower self-esteem are especially drawn to narcissistic leaders, feeling more included and confident under their direction. this early dynamic mirrors what we see in adults, where narcissists often rise to leadership but don’t always deliver results. understanding these patterns is crucial for neuroscience and psychology, as it highlights how personality traits and group dynamics shape leadership from a young age, potentially influencing social development and mental health later in life. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #psychology #leadership #childdevelopment #mentalhealth"

These discoveries, based on findings in neuroscience, music, and psychology, support Neural Resonance Theory (NRT).\nNRT maintains that rather than relying on learned expectations or prediction, musical experiences arise from the brain's natural oscillations that sync with rhythm, melody and harmony. This resonance shapes our sense of timing, musical pleasure and the instinct to move with the beat.\n\"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,\" said Palmer, Professor in the Department of Psychology at McGill and Director of the Sequence Production Lab. \"That has big implications for therapy, education and technology.\" The study's publication in\nNature Reviews Neuroscience\nmarks the first time the entire NRT is being published in a single paper, she said.\nThe theory suggests that structures like pulse and harmony reflect stable resonant patterns in the brain, shared across people independent of their musical background. According to NRT, how we hear and produce music can be explained by fundamental dynamical principles of human brain mechanisms that apply from the ear all the way to the spinal cord and limb movements.\nResearchers say potential applications of the theory include:\nTherapeutic tools for conditions like stroke, Parkinson's and depression\nEmotionally intelligent AI that can respond to or generate music more like humans\nNew learning technologies to support rhythm and pitch education\nCross-cultural insight into why music connects people around the world\nThe study was led by Edward Large (University of Connecticut) and co-authored by Caroline Palmer.\nThe study was funded in part by a Canada Research Chair and a NSERC Discovery Grant.\nRELATED TOPICS\nMind & Brain\nMusic\nK-12 Education\nPerception\nPsychology\nNeuroscience\nBrain Injury\nCreativity\nLanguage Acquisition\nRELATED TERMS\nCognitive neuroscience\nNeuropsychology\nPsychology\nSocial psychology\nCognitive psychology\nPsycholinguistics\nPsychologist\nMemory\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nMcGill University\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nEleanor E.

They evaluate a prompt, consider the surrounding data context, and then sample a next word from a distribution of possibilities. There is no single, inevitable path. Every word is a kind of cognitive dice roll.\nAt first glance, this feels foreign—mechanical, even alien. But the more I reflect on it, the more I wonder if this isn’t a machine thing?\nWhat if it’s a mind thing?\nWhat if we, too, move through the world not with a singular, fixed\nidentity\n, but with a field of internal probabilities, collapsing into selfhood moment by moment?\nWhen you walk into a room, you don’t always show up as the same \"you.\" There’s the confident speaker, the quiet parent, the challenger, the harmonizer. These aren’t masks. They’re versions of you—a range of selves shaped by\nmemory\n, context, intention, and social cues. The self, in this view, is not a singular, unbroken thread. It’s a cloud of possibility that collapses into action. And like an LLM, that collapse is contextual, fluid, and often probabilistic.\nPsychology has long hinted at this\nmultiplicity\nof self.\nErving Goffman\n, famously described identity as performance—a dynamic, socially responsive act. And there's little denying that our online personalities certainly support some level of multiplicity. Even\nneuroscience\nalso supports this. The brain is\na prediction machine\n. It samples and updates from prior experience to determine what to expect next.\nOur sense of self may be less about continuity and more about coherence in the moment.\nIn this light, maybe an LLM isn’t so foreign. It mirrors something curiously human—the act of choosing from within a field of internal probabilities.\nBut here’s the interesting twist. LLMs optimize for likelihood. Humans can defy it. We don’t always collapse to what’s expected or safe. Sometimes we act in direct opposition to our predicted self—taking risks, showing grace, disrupting patterns. Where a model would default to coherence, a human might reach for a more complex realization, dare I say transcendence.\nSo who are you before you choose? A cluster of probabilities, a latent narrative or even a cognitive superposition. And this act of choosing—of collapsing into form—isn’t just how we move through the world, it’s how we become who we are.\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nadvertisement\nAbout the Author\nJohn Nosta\nis an innovation theorist and founder of NostaLab.\nOnline:\nNostalab Official Website\n,\nX\n,\nLinkedIn\nMore from John Nosta\nMore from Psychology Today\nMore from John Nosta\nMore from Psychology Today\nBack\nPsychology Today\nHome\nFind a Therapist\nGet Help\nMagazine\nTests\nBack\nFind a Therapist\nGet Help\nFind a Therapist\nFind a Treatment Center\nFind a Psychiatrist\nFind a Support Group\nFind Online Therapy\nMembers\nLogin\nSign Up\nUnited States\nAustin, TX\nBrooklyn, NY\nChicago, IL\nDenver, CO\nHouston, TX\nLos Angeles, CA\nNew York, NY\nPortland, OR\nSan Diego, CA\nSan Francisco, CA\nSeattle, WA\nWashington, DC\nBack\nGet Help\nMental Health\nAddiction\nAnxiety\nADHD\nAsperger's\nAutism\nBipolar Disorder\nChronic Pain\nDepression\nEating Disorders\nPersonality\nPassive Aggression\nPersonality\nShyness\nPersonal Growth\nGoal Setting\nHappiness\nPositive Psychology\nStopping Smoking\nRelationships\nLow Sexual Desire\nRelationships\nSex\nFamily Life\nChild Development\nParenting\nView Help Index\nDo I Need Help?\nSelf Tests\nNEW\nTherapy Center\nRecently Diagnosed?\nDiagnosis Dictionary\nTypes of Therapy\nTalk to Someone\nFind a Therapist\nFind a Treatment Center\nFind a Psychiatrist\nFind a Support Group\nFind Online Therapy\nBack\nMagazine\nMay 2025\nWhy Your Quirks Are Your Superpowers\nThe brightest way to shine is by being fully, imperfectly yourself.\nSubscribe\nIssue Archive\nBack\nTests\nSelf Tests\nSelf Tests are all about you.

It’s not just a\nmemory\n. It’s a held breath, a clenched jaw, a\nnervous system\nstuck in survival. The body remembers what the mind tries to forget.\nThis is why traditional talk\ntherapy\n, while helpful, often falls short in trauma work. You can name your past, understand it, even reframe it, but if your body still feels unsafe, insight alone can’t unwind the deeper patterns.\nModern neuroscience backs this up: trauma disrupts the autonomic nervous system, leaving many people trapped in cycles of hyperarousal or shutdown. As Dr. Bessel van der Kolk writes in\nThe Body Keeps the Score\n, the body stores trauma in implicit memory, outside of conscious awareness, and requires more than words to heal. Similarly, Dr. Stephen Porges’\nPolyvagal\nTheory explains how trauma can lock the nervous system into protective states that override logical reasoning or insight.\nThis is where somatic therapy, and increasingly, psychedelic-assisted therapy, offers a deeper path forward. These approaches don’t just help us talk about what happened. They help the body complete what was never finished. They create the conditions for the nervous system to reorganize itself, restoring access to safety, regulation, and presence.\nEnter Somatic Therapy: The Body Remembers\nPsychedelics, when used responsibly, legally, and with skilled facilitation, can open an extraordinary window of neuroplasticity and emotional access. Substances like psilocybin, MDMA, and\nketamine\nhave been shown to reduce activity in the brain’s\ndefault mode network\n(DMN), the part associated with ego maintenance, rigid self-narratives, and habitual defenses. When the DMN quiets, we gain access to what’s been buried beneath the surface: long-held emotions, body-based memories, and suppressed truths, often emerging with an unexpected softness, even self compassion (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nBut access is not the same as resolution.\nWithout a way to stay connected to the body, many people may touch profound material during a journey, only to become overwhelmed, flooded, or dissociated by it. The emotional insights may be clear, but the nervous system may still be operating under old instructions: “This is dangerous.” “This is too much.” “You can’t survive this.”\nThis is especially true for individuals with complex or developmental trauma, whose nervous systems were shaped by chronic threat in early\nattachment\nrelationships. When that’s your origin story, the body often equates vulnerability with danger, even in safe, supportive settings.\nThis is where somatic therapy becomes essential.\nSomatic work teaches us to track the language of the body: sensation, impulse, movement, tension, breath. It creates a foundation of inner safety, so when the doors of perception are opened, we’re not just tumbling through. We have an anchor.\nSomatic therapy doesn’t just support psychedelic healing, it amplifies it. It turns insight into integration. It helps the body learn: This time, it’s different. This time, you’re not alone. This time, you get to feel and stay.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Trauma?\nTake our Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Test\nFind a therapist to heal from trauma.\nWhy Psychedelics Open the Door but the Body Walks Us Through It\nPsychedelics like psilocybin or MDMA don’t fix you. They don’t erase trauma or rewrite history. What they do is soften the default defenses, the rigid patterns of avoidance, suppression, and shutdown that normally keep trauma walled off.\nUnder the right conditions (safe setting, skilled support, careful preparation), psychedelics can allow for access to emotional and somatic material that is otherwise too overwhelming, too fragmented, or too deeply buried to reach in regular consciousness.\nThey can invite a person into the very sensations that have been too much to feel. But that’s where somatic work becomes crucial. Without a grounded way to stay in the body, to notice what’s happening, to orient, to move, to discharge, someone may\ndissociate\n,\npanic\n",
    "summary": "trauma isn’t just a memory—it lives in our bodies, shaping how we breathe, move, and feel. while talk therapy can help us understand our past, true healing often requires more. neuroscience shows trauma disrupts our nervous system, keeping us stuck in patterns of stress or shutdown. psychedelics like psilocybin and mdma can open doors to deep emotional healing, but without somatic therapy—approaches that help us tune into our body’s sensations and responses—these journeys can be overwhelming or incomplete.\n\ncombining psychedelics with somatic work grounds the experience, helping us feel safe and present as we process old wounds. this integration supports lasting change, teaching the body that healing is possible and that it’s finally safe to feel. as research in neuroscience and therapy evolves, the partnership of somatic work and psychedelics is showing new promise for trauma recovery.\n\n🌱✨\n\n#traumahealing #somatictherapy #psychedelictherapy #mentalhealth #neuroscience #healingjourney"

One such influential framework is the PASS theory, developed from the work of Soviet neuropsychologist Alexander Luria and later expanded by J.P. Das, Jack A. Naglieri, and Kirby. PASS stands for Planning,\nAttention\n, Simultaneous, and Successive—four distinct but interrelated cognitive processes underlie human intelligence and learning (Das, Naglieri, & Kirby, 1994). Rather than viewing intelligence as a single, unified trait, the PASS theory proposes a functional model of\ncognition\nthat reflects how different brain regions support different mental operations.\nThis model has profound implications for approaching individual learning differences, instructional design, and educational assessment. Understanding the PASS model allows educators to tailor interventions that strengthen specific cognitive processes rather than relying solely on traditional IQ-based approaches.\nOrigins of the PASS Theory: Luria's Neuropsychological Framework\nAlexander Luria, a pioneer in neuropsychology, proposed that the brain consists of three central functional units (Luria, 1973). These units—responsible for arousal and attention, processing and storing information, and planning and regulating behavior—form the basis of the PASS model.\nBuilding on Luria's model, Das, Naglieri, and Kirby (1994) restructured cognitive processing into four domains:\nPlanning: This refers to\ngoal-setting\n,\ndecision-making\n, and self-monitoring.\nAttention: The capacity to selectively attend to relevant stimuli while inhibiting distractions.\nSimultaneous Processing: The ability to integrate separate stimuli into a unified whole, essential for understanding spatial and logical relationships.\nSuccessive Processing: Sequential information processing is crucial for language comprehension and phonological decoding.\nThese processes are viewed as dynamic and interdependent, forming the building blocks of cognitive functioning across tasks and domains.\nEducational Implications of the PASS Model\nCognitive Strength-Based Instruction\nOne of the most important contributions of the PASS theory is its shift from a fixed view of intelligence to a process-oriented approach. Traditional intelligence tests often emphasize verbal and mathematical reasoning, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of human cognition. In contrast, assessments based on the PASS model—such as the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS2)—help educators identify students' cognitive profiles, enabling strength-based instruction (Naglieri, Das, & Goldstein, 2014).\nFor example, a child with strong simultaneous processing skills but weak successive processing may excel in visual-spatial tasks but struggle with reading fluency. In this case, interventions might focus on phonological training while leveraging the student's strengths in visual processing for comprehension tasks.\nSupporting Students With Learning Disabilities\nPASS theory offers a neuropsychological lens through which learning disabilities can be better understood and addressed. Children with\nADHD\n, for instance, often exhibit impairments in attention and planning, leading to inconsistent academic performance. Rather than attributing these struggles to low intelligence, PASS emphasizes how deficits in specific processing areas can hinder learning despite average or even high\ngeneral intelligence\n.\nTHE BASICS\nWhy Education Is Important\nTake our ADHD Test\nFind a Child Therapist\nInterventions based on PASS would aim to strengthen attention control and\nself-regulation\nthrough structured routines, metacognitive strategies, and environmental modifications (Das & Misra, 2015). This approach is more individualized and neurodevelopmentally informed than traditional remediation strategies.\nCurriculum Design and Executive Function\nExecutive function skills—planning, self-monitoring, and task flexibility—are increasingly recognized as crucial for academic success. The Planning component of PASS closely aligns with these\nexecutive functions\n. Schools incorporating project-based learning, inquiry-driven instruction, and reflective journaling provide opportunities for students to practice and develop planning skills.\nEducation\nEssential Reads\nHow to Prepare for Final Exams\nIs Cognitive Science Really Helping in the Clas",
    "summary": "curious how your brain really learns? 🧠 the PASS theory, rooted in neuroscience, breaks intelligence into four key processes: planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive processing. instead of focusing on a single “IQ,” this approach recognizes that everyone’s brain has unique strengths and challenges. educators using PASS-informed assessments can better support all learners—especially those with learning differences like adhd—by targeting specific cognitive skills rather than relying on one-size-fits-all tests. this shift is reshaping classrooms, making learning more individualized and effective. as neuroscience deepens our understanding of how the brain works, approaches like PASS are helping schools move beyond labels and nurture every student’s potential. #neuroscience #learning #education #adhd #brainpower"

Since then, we have published 206 articles on Psychology Today in which we have extended discussions in the book regarding advances in clinical and preclinical science.\nThe principles of treatment we outlined in the book remain timely. However, substantial progress in available treatments has occurred over the last 15 years. We mention some of these developments below.\nBasic Principles of Psychiatric Treatment\nWe initially outlined seven basic principles of\npsychiatric\ncare in\nDemystifying Psychiatry\n. These remain relevant today and bear repeating:\nAccurate diagnosis is important in determining appropriate treatment.\nClose communication between the treatment team and the patient is essential.\nSome symptoms require aggressive action, including emergency care.\nThings take time.\nThe effective use of medications requires expertise on the part of the practitioner.\nTypes of treatment should be tailored to a patient’s individual circumstances.\nAs much as possible, patients should be involved in their own care.\nExamples of Major Treatment Advances\nSince we published\nDemystifying Psychiatry\n, basic and clinical\nneuroscience\nresearch has led to new treatments with novel mechanisms of action that differ from older treatments. Prior to these more recent advances, new treatments involved tweaking approaches that had been available since the 1960s.\nBelow, we list several new treatments that have become available for\npost-partum depression\n, treatment-resistant\ndepression\n, and schizophrenia. Other novel treatments are on the horizon.\n1. Postpartum depression\nNeuroactive steroids, a new category of medications with rapid onset of action, have been shown to be very effective in treating this painful and potentially devastating disorder. Both intravenous (brexanolone) and oral (zuranolone) treatments were approved for clinical use. Because of the success and easier use of the orally active agent, the intravenous treatment was recently discontinued.\n2. Severe treatment-resistant depression\nMedications that work by influencing the glutamate neurotransmitter system are currently available. Such drugs include\nesketamine\n, an FDA-approved nasal spray; intravenous ketamine (off-label use); and an oral drug that combines dextromethorphan and bupropion. Ketamine-based drugs work much more rapidly than traditional\nantidepressants\n.\nAdvances in methods using repetitive\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation\n(rTMS) have made this form of neuromodulation treatment more effective and more broadly available. One example is the Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) that combines an aggressive form of rTMS with brain system mapping. SNT has shown promise in treating severe, treatment-resistant depression.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Psychiatry?\nTake our Depression Test\nFind a therapist near me\nThe availability of this treatment is limited, but it may offer life-saving care for those who haven’t responded to other treatments. Other forms of rTMS are also more routinely available for clinical use.\n3. Schizophrenia\nA recently approved\nmedication\n, xanomeline-trospium, is effective in decreasing positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. This drug’s mechanism of action differs significantly from prior antipsychotic medications in that it directly influences the acetylcholinergic (muscarinic) neurotransmitter system.\nAdvances in Treatment Delivery\nBecause of the limited number of psychiatrists, many patients are still not able to be evaluated or treated by psychiatrists. Yet there has been progress in treatment delivery. Examples include:\nThe more routine use of telepsychiatry (including Zoom and other computer-based technologies) to reach patients at distant locations.\nThe increasing use of treatment teams that include psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants, psychologists, and social workers.\nCollaborative care models that involve the integration of mental health professionals into the offices of primary care providers.\nPsychiatry Essential Reads\nDistinguishing Borderline From Bipolar Spectrum Disor",
    "summary": "psychiatry has seen major breakthroughs in the last 15 years, transforming how we understand and treat mental health conditions. while the basics—accurate diagnosis, personalized care, and strong patient-provider communication—remain essential, neuroscience has fueled innovative treatments. new medications for postpartum depression and treatment-resistant depression, like neuroactive steroids and ketamine-based therapies, offer faster relief than traditional options. cutting-edge neuromodulation methods, such as advanced rTMS, provide hope for those who haven’t responded to other treatments. for schizophrenia, novel drugs now target different brain systems, improving outcomes for more patients. plus, telepsychiatry and collaborative care models are making expert help more accessible than ever. these advances highlight the ongoing evolution in mental health care, driven by neuroscience and a commitment to patient-centered treatment. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #psychiatry #mentalhealth #innovation #brainhealth"

The research recently published in\nNPJ Science of Learning\nused a virtual reality game that involved picking flowers with bees in some of the blossoms that would sting the participant -- simulated by a mild electrical stimulation on the hand.\nResearchers worked with 70 neurotypical participants between the ages of 20 and 30. Claire Marino, a research assistant in the ZVR Lab, and Pavel Rjabtsenkov, a Neuroscience graduate student at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, were co-first authors of the study that found that the people who learned to distinguish between the safe and dangerous areas -- where the bees were and were not -- showed better spatial memory and had lower anxiety, while participants who did not learn the different areas had higher anxiety and heightened fear even in safe areas. Surprisingly, they discovered that temporary feelings of anxiety had the biggest impact on learning and not a person's general tendency to feel anxious.\n\"These results help explain why some people struggle with anxiety-related disorders, such as PTSD, where they may have difficulty distinguishing safe situations from dangerous ones,\" said the senior author of this study, Benjamin Suarez-Jimenez, PhD, associate professor of Neuroscience and Center for Visual Science at the Del Monte Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Rochester. \"The findings suggest that excessive anxiety disrupts spatial learning and threat recognition, which could contribute to chronic fear responses. Understanding these mechanisms may help improve treatments for anxiety and stress-related disorders by targeting how people process environmental threats.\"\nSuarez-Jimenez explains that it is now important to understand if individuals with psychopathologies of anxiety and stress have similar variations in spatial memory. Adding an attention-tracking measure, like eye-tracking, to future studies could help determine whether a focus on potential threats impacts broader environmental awareness.\nAdditional authors include Caitlin Sharp, Zonia Ali, Evelyn Pineda, Shreya Bavdekar, Tanya Garg, Kendal Jordan, Mary Halvorsen, Carlos Aponte, and Julie Blue of the University of Rochester Medical Center, and Xi Zhu, PhD, of Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Once he reached an appropriate level of recovery, and after consulting with all relevant medical staff—including Paul and George, the sons of Professor Bach-y-Rita—the hospital administration arranged to formally discharge the Professor into their care. This situation ultimately marked the beginning of a rehabilitation program developed by George, who was a medical student at the time.\nInitially, George felt uncertain about his next steps. Ultimately, he determined that his father's rehabilitation model would be grounded in the developmental movement progression of infants (Doidge, 2010). He remarked, “The only model I had was how babies learn…to walk” (Doidge, 2010, p. 21). According to White et al. (2013), children start to advance to crawling between six to ten months of age, building their skills as a result of all the developmental movements that occurred since birth, which continually shape the infant's brain and body.\nAnd So, the Crawling Rehabilitation Began\nThe crawling stage also includes a markedly more advanced and intricate movement progression that engages all four limbs. This complex movement progression allows infants to navigate independently within and around their environment.\nThis stage represents the ongoing development of both the brain and body, ultimately leading to the point when, by the age of 12 to 15 months, infants can take their first steps without assistance, marking the onset of walking (Adolph et al., 2012).\nKeeping this universal developmental model in mind, George explained to his father that infants ultimately learn to walk through crawling (Doidge, 2010). Thus, the crawling rehabilitation commenced.\nThree years of daily “\nchild development\ncrawling” rehabilitation followed, resulting in what might be considered a full recovery (Bach-y-Rita, 1980; Doidge, 2010; Hunter, 1987; Purnell, 2015). This rehabilitation approach and the resultant recovery completely contradicted the prevailing medical\nwisdom\nof that time.\nThe Value and Significance of Crawling as a Holistic Rehabilitation Modality\nInterestingly, related to this, George and Paul were ridiculed at the time for allowing something as “humiliating” as crawling like a baby to happen to their father (see Bach-y-Rita, 1980). Doidge (2015) emphasises the importance of crawling by referring to the work of Moshé Feldenkrais, who highlighted its value and significance as a holistic rehabilitation modality.\nMoshé Feldenkrais believed that walking depends on the neurological and neuromuscular foundational support provided by crawling. According to Doidge (2015, p. 189), Feldenkrais argued that any “attempts to leapfrog through development is a huge error.”\nThe Return to His Position as a College Professor\nDoidge (2015, p. 189) also argued that “no one ever learned to walk by walking. Other skills must be in place for a child to walk—skills that adults don’t think about or remember learning.” As noted above, it was this daily recovery regimen centred around crawling that ultimately led to the situation where Professor Bach-y-Rita could return to his position as a college professor three years after his stroke.\nFormer World Boxing Champion John Famechon\nSource: Source John Famechon and Frank Quill The Method\nFamechon, Bach-y-Rita, Feldenkrais\nWith Moshé Feldenkrais mentioned, I'll include his story. I believe this information about Feldenkrais, as with Bach-y-Rita, provides valuable medical and holistic acquired brain injury (ABI) rehabilitation background that can be compared and contrasted to the ABI recovery of former World Boxing Champion John Famechon.\nFeldenkrais, Soccer, Judo, Physics\nMoshé Feldenkrais was born in Ukraine in 1904, at that time part of the Russian Empire.

    "summary": "can crawling like a baby help heal the brain? 🧠 this inspiring story highlights how a college professor made a full recovery from a catastrophic stroke by following a unique rehab method: daily crawling, just like infants do before they walk. this approach, rooted in our earliest developmental stages, challenges the old belief that only “adult” movements matter in recovery. neuroscience now recognizes the power of neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to rewire and heal through movement. crawling activates complex pathways, building the foundation needed for walking and other skills. this story reminds us that sometimes, going back to basics can unlock new possibilities in brain injury rehab. 🦶✨\n\n#neuroplasticity #brainhealth #rehabilitation #crawlingtherapy #neuroscience #recoveryjourney"

What's next? For some of us, it's time to celebrate with an epic overseas adventure. Science backs up the importance of celebrating milestones—because recognizing big wins is key to sustaining future motivation (Hoffman, 2025). A little downtime allows us to recharge our batteries, and a pat on the back feels good. According to\nneuroscience\n, judicious reward is one effective way to attain even bigger future success (Schultz, 2016).\nI'm a self-proclaimed travel junkie. For 17 years, I've been collecting passport stamps like dogs collect ticks in the forest. So, when I submitted my latest book draft to the publisher, you bet I packed my bags for three glorious weeks in Europe. But what started as a victory lap turned into a wake-up call. You see, I'd checked the weather, researched the best gelato spots, and even spent weeks refreshing my Italian and Spanish \"Where is the bathroom\" and \"Can I have a little discount\" phrases. But I'd completely missed the memo about how differently some travelers are being treated these days.\nWhen \"Lost in Translation\" Becomes \"Lost in Frustration\"\nIn Spain, I woke up with this agonizing pain in my side. No biggie, I hoped—but I bolted into the hospital to be sure I wasn’t dying in a foreign country. But here's where things turned sourer than my stomach. The doctor told me that their major hospital didn't have ultrasound equipment. Really? In a brand-new facility in a major modern city? Something felt off. Later, I asked a local who confirmed my suspicions. Guess what? He had no trouble getting an ultrasound at the same hospital.\nFast forward to lunch in Rome. Everything's fine until the bill arrives. There's this mysterious \"service charge\" on top of the usual cover charge. Now, I've traveled enough to know what’s normal—in Italy, they actually frown on tipping! When I questioned it, the server grudgingly removed it. Out of curiosity, in my broken Italian, I asked a local couple if they got hit with the same charge. Their emphatic \"no,\" understandable in any language, said it all.\nHere are a few more gems from my latest adventure:\nGetting loudly scolded at the airport for pouring water into a recycling bin, only to watch a local do the exact same thing 30 seconds later without a peep.\nBeing berated by a random person for my shopping cart etiquette in the middle of the European power blackout and the ensuing toilet paper rush.\nWaiting patiently in line for my morning croissant while locals who arrived after me were immediately served upon entry.\nYou know that sinking feeling when you realize you're not imagining things? Yeah, that's what hit me. Humans are natural pattern-seekers, and when the same weird stuff keeps happening, your brain starts connecting the dots (Goossens, 2000). Turns out, there's actual science backing up what I was feeling. For the first time in nearly two decades of globe-trotting, I felt less like an honored guest and more like an uninvited relative showing up unannounced at a holiday dinner.\nThe Psychology of \"Why Don't They Like Me Anymore?\"\nSource: Bobby Hoffman\nYou know what makes us love traveling? We're like kids in a candy store—everything's exciting, every face is a potential friend, and every meal is\nInstagram\n-worthy. But when that warm welcome turns chilly, it messes with our heads more than\njet lag\never could.\nResearch describes what I experienced as \"social exchange theory,\" but I call it basic human\ndecision-making\n, which, in part, is based on\nemotion\n. When people are nice to us, we feel good. When they're not, we start questioning everything (Yoon, Gursoy, & Chen, 2001). Did I say something wrong? Was it my obnoxious “peace and love” backpack?\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Motivation?\nTake our Burnout Test\nFind a therapist near me\nMotivation researchers have found that negative experiences diminish\nintrinsic motivation\nto travel more powerfully than positive experiences can enhance it (Nawijn & Fricke, 2015).

    "summary": "celebrating achievements with travel can be a powerful motivator—science shows rewarding ourselves boosts future drive and goal-setting. but recent experiences abroad reveal a new reality: negative encounters, like feeling unwelcome or treated unfairly, impact our brains more deeply than positive ones. neuroscience highlights how these social slights can actually diminish our intrinsic motivation for future adventures. as global attitudes shift, it’s a reminder that our emotional brain is wired to spot patterns and protect us from discomfort—even if that means putting the passport away for a while. sometimes, the biggest reward is safeguarding our own peace of mind. 🌍✈️\n\n#neuroscience #motivation #travelpsychology #mentalhealth #goalsetting"

Digital culture, public health scares, and shifting social norms are all influencing not just how symptoms appear, but how they must be treated. The very nature of our daily lives is giving rise to new afflictions, creating fresh challenges for those living with OCD and the professionals supporting them.\nTraditionally, OCD has been known for its familiar patterns: fears of contamination leading to endless hand washing, compulsive checking of locks or appliances, unwanted intrusive thoughts, and a relentless drive for symmetry or order. But as our world changes, so do the ways OCD can manifest. The core experience—unwanted,\nanxiety\n-provoking thoughts followed by rituals meant to relieve that anxiety—remains the same. What’s changing is the content and context, as modern life presents a whole new set of triggers.\nAlthough these patterns are increasingly observed, experiences with OCD remain diverse. The impact of modern forces may vary across cultural, generational, and individual backgrounds.\nHow are Modern Forces Shaping OCD?\nDigital Culture:\nSocial Media\nand Infomania\nIf you’ve ever found yourself compulsively checking your phone, you’re not alone. For people with OCD, the digital world offers endless opportunities for obsessions and compulsions to take root.\nRecent research links excessive\nscreen time\nto elevated\ncompulsive behaviors\n, especially in adolescents. This includes compulsive searching, reassurance-seeking, and online checking rituals (Robbins et al., 2019). Social media intensifies comparison obsessions,\nperfectionism\n, and fears of saying or doing something wrong, prompting behaviors like rereading posts or googling symptoms repeatedly (Williams et al., 2017).\nInfomania\nSource: Franco Monsalvo / Pexels\nThe pressure to present a perfect life online can also fuel fears of social rejection or moral failure, feeding into OCD’s relentless drive for certainty and control.\nPatient vignette:\nTake “Alex,” a young professional, who compulsively rereads every email he sends, checking repeatedly for tone, clarity, and hidden meanings. He revisits the same message a dozen times, unable to move on until he feels absolutely sure, though that certainty rarely comes.\n(Name and identifying details have been changed to protect confidentiality.)\nHealth Anxiety in a Post-Pandemic World\nContamination fears have long been a hallmark of OCD, but the\nCOVID-19\npandemic intensified these concerns. Behaviors once seen as excessive, like frequent hand washing or avoiding public spaces, suddenly became socially reinforced.\nFor many with OCD, the anxiety didn’t stop there. It evolved into compulsive health monitoring, symptom-checking, and a deep\nfear\nof unknowingly making others sick (Fineberg et al., 2020; Hopkins Medicine, 2022). These behaviors can surface even in those with no prior OCD diagnosis, often triggered by\nstress\n, loss, or uncertainty (Fontenelle, Mendlowicz, Marques, & Versiani, 2004).\nMoral Scrupulosity and Cancel Culture\nToday’s cultural landscape places a premium on being “good,” “woke,” and on the “right side of history.” While this encourages reflection and accountability, it can also heighten moral scrupulosity in people with OCD: obsessive fears of being a bad person, causing harm, or being publicly shamed.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?\nTake our Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test\nFind a therapist to treat OCD\nCompulsions may include excessive apologizing, reviewing past conversations, or avoiding social settings entirely (Abramowitz & Jacoby, 2014). In\nspiritual\nor religious contexts, scrupulosity may involve repetitive confession or prayer. In cultural settings with rigid\ngender\nor moral norms,\nshame\n-based compulsions can be especially distressing (Williams et al., 2017).\nClinicians may adapt ERP by aligning exposures with clients’ belief systems—for instance, reframing uncertainty as spiritual humility or emphasizing compassion over certainty (Williams et al., 2017).\nIdentity\nand Existence Obsessions\nIden",
    "summary": "OCD is changing with the times—today’s digital world, constant social pressure, and post-pandemic anxieties are reshaping how symptoms show up. While classic OCD patterns like checking and hand washing remain, new triggers are emerging: endless scrolling, compulsive online checking, perfectionism from social media, health worries, and fears of moral failure or public shaming. The need for certainty and control is amplified by information overload and the pressure to present a “perfect” self online. These modern stressors mean that OCD is more than just old fears—it’s evolving with our culture, tech, and daily lives. Neuroscience and therapy now face the challenge of adapting treatments to address these new realities, helping people find balance and peace in a hyperconnected world. 🌐🧠\n\n#ocd #mentalhealth #neuroscience #anxiety #digitalage #wellness"

    "text": "Stop Chasing Comfort, Start Building the Future You | Psychology Today\nSkip to main content\nBrian Williamson Ed.D.\nAchieving the Objective\nEmotional Intelligence\nStop Chasing Comfort, Start Building the Future You\nThe future you is an unfinished prototype.\nPosted\nApril 21, 2025\n|\nReviewed by Lybi Ma\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nKey points\nGrowth comes from embracing discomfort, not from seeking comfort or immediate results.\nIdentity evolution requires releasing outdated roles and accepting productive discomfort.\nMental toughness and resilience are built by pushing through perceived limits, not avoiding them.\nPsychological safety and feedback are essential for personal development and successful transitions.\nIn a world obsessed with instant results, busyness is often mistaken for progress. Meetings, emails, and endless tasks can create the illusion of momentum, but are we moving forward? True growth doesn’t come from checking boxes; it comes from leaning into the uncomfortable, uncertain work of becoming who we’re meant to be.\nPsychologists like Walter Mischel and Carol Dweck have shown that while we’re wired for immediate gratification, lasting development requires embracing productive discomfort. Discomfort, in the right context, isn’t a warning sign; it’s proof that growth is happening.\nThe best leaders, teams, and organizations don’t avoid discomfort, they use it. It’s their edge for\ninnovation\n,\nresilience\n, and transformation.—Brene Brown, University of Houston\nThe future you is an unfinished prototype\nThrough repeated endurance challenges, I discovered the true power of the 40 Percent Rule: the real limit isn’t physical, it's mental. Discomfort wasn’t a sign to stop; it was my mind clinging to the familiar. Resilience isn’t just about pushing through, it's about realizing how much more you're capable of.\nThese experiences revealed something deeper: discomfort isn’t the enemy, it’s the entry point. Life’s transitions, whether chosen or forced, are often uncomfortable. But that discomfort? It’s not just to be survived, it’s a catalyst for growth.\nFive ways to embrace it.\nLean Into Stretch Experiences\nGrowth rarely happens in comfort. Transitions often feel heavy because we carry the weight of outdated expectations and identity scripts. Our narrative identity is the evolving story we tell ourselves about who we are. To move forward with intention, we must first release what no longer serves us. Rituals of release, like writing a letter to your former self and burning it or leaving behind a symbolic object on a walk, can create psychological closure, a process linked to emotional integration and renewal.\nNext, seek out stretch experiences:\ntake a solo trip, learn a new skill, or pursue a goal that intimidates you. These challenges activate the\ngrowth mindset\n, the belief that abilities evolve through effort. Stretching yourself builds\nconfidence\n,\nneural\nadaptability, and a deeper capacity for uncertainty.\nThe goal isn’t to erase the past. It’s to loosen your grip on who you were, so you can grow into who you’re becoming.\nInvite Honest Feedback and Self-Reflection\nLife transitions often trigger identity dissonance: the uncomfortable gap between your past self and your emerging one. Clinging to outdated roles, like the overachiever, the people-pleaser, or the expert, can lead to identity foreclosure, where we lock ourselves into fixed narratives too early or for too long.\nTo evolve, we need mirrors. Honest feedback from trusted mentors, friends, or colleagues can offer blind-spot clarity and help expand our sense of self. At the same time, self-reflection practices like journaling,\nmindfulness\n, or even voice-memo reflection can deepen\nself-concept\nclarity and a stable, coherent understanding of who you are across time.\nTreat identity as a draft, not a declaration, ask:\nWhat part of me is ready to be released? What values no longer fit?\nThis isn’t about erasing the past. It’s about consciously reauthoring the story of you.—Cory Muscara, author and former monk\nFocus on Progress, Not Perfection\nNature doesn’t grow in straight lines, and neither do you. Progress is often irregular, nonlinear, and full of feedback loops. Instead of forcing a rigid plan, consider a fractal mindset: the idea that small, self-similar shifts across different areas of life can lead to exponential transformation.\nThis is how change works in the real world: through micro-adjustments.\nShift your morning routine by five minutes. Reframe one piece of internal dialogue. Swap one unhelpful habit for something nourishing. Each act wires your brain for change, reinforcing the principle of neuroplasticity, that your brain is always capable of rewiring toward who you’re becoming.\nEmotional Intelligence\nEssential Reads\nEmotional Knowing in Relationships\nThe Magnetic Power of Emotional Maturity\nProgress isn’t about having it all figured out. It’s about showing up, again and again, with just enough curiosity and courage to take the n",
    "summary": "true growth begins at the edge of your comfort zone. neuroscience shows that our brains thrive on challenge—embracing discomfort actually rewires neural pathways, building resilience and adaptability. instead of chasing instant results or clinging to old identities, lean into stretch experiences, seek honest feedback, and focus on small, consistent progress. every uncomfortable moment is a chance to update your brain’s story and become the future you. remember: discomfort isn’t a setback, it’s the signal that you’re evolving. 🌱✨\n\n#neuroscience #growthmindset #resilience #mentalhealth #selfdevelopment"

The study, detailing these epigenetic mechanisms in the brain, uncovers a new molecular target for the development of novel SUD treatments.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nNew research on the biological basis of addiction has found that the critical epigenetic enzyme histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) limits the expression of the gene Scn4b, regulating neuronal activity and thereby the formation of strong drug-related memories, which can trigger relapse in individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). The study in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier, detailing these epigenetic mechanisms in the brain, uncovers a new molecular target for the development of novel SUD treatments.\nSUDs affect many individuals in the United States directly or indirectly. Drug-related deaths remain at an all-time high in the US and stimulant use specifically is on the rise worldwide. Despite ongoing efforts, rates of SUDs have remained relatively stable over the past three decades, indicating a need for continued focus on treatment and prevention strategies. Understanding the neurological basis of addiction, often considered a complex biobehavioral illness, holds potential for broader insights into human decision-making, motivation, and behavior.\nSUDs are characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences, and relapse affects a large proportion of individuals with SUD attempting to discontinue drug use. One major contributor to relapse risk is the presence of enduring associations between the primary rewarding effects of the drug and cues in the drug-use environment.\nJohn Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, comments, \"People say that once you have experienced compulsive substance use, your relationship to that substance can never return to the pre-addiction state. How could these long-lasting associations be sustained? One possibility is that there are long-lasting changes in the pattern of gene expression that encode these drug memories and that prevent these memories from weakening. This study points to epigenetic mechanisms, one of the processes regulating gene expression patterns on a long-term basis, as a key regulator of relapse-related cocaine consumption.\"\nCo-lead investigator Christopher W. Cowan, PhD, Department of Neuroscience, Medical University of South Carolina, explains, \"In this study, we discovered that a critical epigenetic enzyme HDAC5 functions to limit the expression of Scn4b, which limits the firing of key neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain region linked to SUD and reward-related behavior. Together with our prior work, our findings show that HDAC5 and SCN4B, via regulation of neuronal excitability, selectively limit the formation of powerful and long-lasting links between the drug use environment and the drug use experience that can later serve as triggers of relapse in individuals with a SUD that are attempting to abstain from a return to active drug use.\"\nIn a highly collaborative multilevel study, investigators deployed a wide array of research techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry, enzymatic activity assays, computational modeling, quantitative mRNA analysis, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and rat cocaine and sucrose self-administration. One of the most significant results is the new finding that a sodium channel auxiliary protein, SCN4B, functions to limit relapse-like cocaine seeking but without affecting seeking of a natural reward, sucrose. This suggests that SCN4B governs a form of drug-specific plasticity that creates prepotent drug-environment associations that can promote relapse.\nCo-lead investigator Daniel J. Wood, MD, PhD candidate, Department of Neuroscience, and Medical Science Training Program, Medical University of South Carolina, notes, \"Finding new ways to help people recovering from SUD remain abstinent is as important as ever. The fact that SCN4B is selectively involved in the relapse-like cocaine seeking, but had no effect on sucrose seeking was very surprising to us. SCN4Bmight be a key puzzle piece toward uncovering drug-induced maladaptive plasticity that drives prepotent drug-environment associations and relapse vulnerability, and it represents a novel therapeutic target for developing treatments that reduce relapse risk in SUD.\"\nDr. Krystal concludes, \"The deeper neuroscience probes into addiction, the more we uncover fun",
    "summary": "new research has revealed that the enzyme hdac5 plays a key role in addiction by limiting the expression of the gene scn4b, which helps regulate brain activity and the formation of powerful drug-related memories. these memories often trigger relapse in those recovering from substance use disorders. by uncovering this epigenetic mechanism, scientists have identified a promising new target for developing treatments to prevent relapse. with addiction rates and drug-related deaths still high, understanding how the brain forms and maintains these lasting associations is more important than ever for neuroscience and mental health. this breakthrough brings hope for more effective therapies that could help people stay on the path to recovery. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #addiction #mentalhealth #epigenetics #sciencenews"

The buildup of amyloid plaques can be detected decades before symptoms appear. These plaques can be visualized and quantified by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\nThe researchers wanted to understand how people react emotionally to learning whether they have risk for cognitive decline.\nThe study followed 199 healthy adults who underwent amyloid PET scans to check their amyloid beta status. Before the scan, participants completed surveys measuring anxiety, depression, memory concerns and motivation for lifestyle adjustments. They conducted the same surveys six months after learning their results.\nResults from the study show that participants who don't have amyloid buildup experienced significant emotional improvements: They reported much lower levels of depression, anxiety and memory complaints.\nHowever, their motivation to maintain lifestyle improvements also declined.\nConversely, participants with amyloid presence didn't show increased depression or memory complaints but did experience a decrease in anxiety and motivation for lifestyle adjustments.\n\"The findings suggest that disclosing amyloid presence does not negatively affect participants, and simply knowing the results seems to decrease negative feelings overall,\" said Schnaider Beeri.\nThis study provides new insight into how individuals emotionally respond to learning their amyloid status, an underexplored topic, the researchers said. It also involves disclosing amyloid status to cognitively healthy individuals, a practice that wasn't common in previous studies.\n\"The results highlight how easily people lose motivation to make lifestyle changes aimed at maintaining cognitive health,\" said Shekhtman. \"Strategies to sustain these healthy behaviors are crucial.\"\n\"These findings hold even greater significance in an era moving toward preventive Alzheimer's Disease therapies,\" said Lesman-Segev. \"When such treatments become available, cognitively normal individuals will likely undergo screening with Alzheimer's biomarkers to qualify for targeted therapies. Therefore, it is essential to better understand the response to disclosure and optimize the disclosure process.\"\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nAlzheimer's Research\nHealthy Aging\nMental Health Research\nStaying Healthy\nMind & Brain\nAlzheimer's\nDementia\nIntelligence\nDisorders and Syndromes\nRELATED TERMS\nLimbic system\nAlzheimer's disease\nPersonalized medicine\nDiabetic diet\nEmotional detachment\nHealthy diet\nDementia with Lewy bodies\nNutrition and pregnancy\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nRutgers University\n.

    "text": "The Friendship Recession: The Lost Art of Connecting — The Leadership & Happiness Laboratory\n0\nThe Friendship Recession: The Lost Art of Connecting\nFeb 28\nWritten By\nBryce Fuemmeler\nFebruary 2025 Issue\nCarolyn Bruckmann, Harvard Kennedy School MPP ‘25\nThe so-called “Friendship Recession” is making its way into the vernacular—a profound shift in how Americans experience and sustain friendships. The data paints a stark picture. According to the\nAmerican Perspectives Survey\n, the percentage of U.S. adults who report having no close friends has quadrupled to 12% since 1990, while the percentage of those with ten or more close friends has fallen by nearly threefold. The foundations of the crisis were laid long before lockdowns. For decades, Americans consistently spent about 6.5 hours a week with friends. Then, between 2014 and 2019, that number plummeted to just four hours per week.\nTo be sure, systemic forces underlie this shift.\nSuburban sprawl\nhas physically distanced us from one another.\nThe government slowed down\nits investment in and construction of\nthird spaces\n—such as community centers, parks, and coffee shops—which has left fewer places for organic social interactions. The rise of the\ngig economy\nand economic pressures have made free time a luxury. These factors have made friendship more difficult, and policymakers, urban planners, and venture capitalists are searching for solutions.\nHowever, these structural forces alone can't fully account for the larger shift. If inaccessibility were the primary driver, we wouldn’t see relatively\nstable connection rates\namong older adults over the last several decades. If wealthier individuals have more access to communal spaces, why has\nsolo dining increased by 29% in the past two years\n? If this were purely circumstantial, why would Stanford now offer\nDesign for Healthy Friendships\n—a class dedicated to helping students structure their social lives with intention?\nThese trends point to something more insidious: a cultural crisis. As\nAnne Helen Petersen writes\n, “time for friends is a privilege, but it is also a matter of priorities.” The way we spend our time, whom we invest in, and what we prioritize is shifting.\nSolitude is becoming more than a preference\n—it’s becoming a default. And when not used\nwell\n, the result of solitude isn’t just fewer friendships—it’s a fundamental loss of the ability to form and sustain them. If we don’t consciously reshape our priorities and re-learn how to cultivate meaningful relationships, we risk a future where connection—one of the most fundamental sources of happiness and well-being—fades into the background of our lives.\nThe cultural shift\nWork has become a dominant social identity\nIt’s often said that if you ask an American what they do, they’ll tell you about their job, whereas a European might talk about their hobbies or passions. Data backs this up; U.S. workers put in an average of\n1,799 hours per year\n, which is 182 more hours than the OECD country average. But the role of work in shaping identity and social life in the United States has perhaps never been stronger. For example,\n77% of Americans\nwork more than 40 hours per week, and\nfew take their full paid leave\n.\nPew Research\nsuggests that the percentage of adults 65 and older who are employed has nearly doubled since 1987, rising from 11% to 19%.\nThese shifts are in part driven by broader\neconomic forces\n. Higher cost of living and stagnating wages for low-and middle-income earners means that everyday Americans must work harder to keep up. However, these shifts also suggest a deeper cultural transformation may be occurring—one where the old American ethos of working hard and climbing the economic ladder has evolved into an all-consuming, identity-defining pursuit that leaves little room for much else.\nIn a study\nof generational shifts in work values in the United States, researchers found that Americans are placing greater importance on intrinsic work values—such as having interesting jobs and work that helps others and society. Finding meaning in work (obviously) isn’t a problem\nper se.\nYet when finding fulfillment in work comes at the expense of meaningful personal relationships, it becomes a problem—one that risks leaving individuals fulfilled in their careers but isolated in their personal lives.\nThe focus is increasingly on the nuclear family\nAs work has become increasingly all-encompassing, Americans have also doubled down on prioritizing their families—particularly their children—over friendships. One 2013\nPew Research study\nfound that 49% of parents report spending more time with their kids than their own parents did, while 33% report spending the same amount of time, and 18% report spending less time. These trends reflect a cultural shift towards “intensive parenting.” A child’s achievements are an extension of their parents’ competence, which fuels an arms race of over-scheduling, constant supervision, and exhaustive emotional labor. This model of parenting",
    "summary": "the “friendship recession” is reshaping how we connect, with fewer americans reporting close friendships and more people spending time alone than ever before. while economic pressures, suburban sprawl, and fewer communal spaces play a role, there’s a deeper cultural shift at work—our identities are increasingly tied to our jobs and families, leaving less space for friendships. neuroscience shows that social connection is vital for brain health, happiness, and resilience. as solitude becomes the default, we risk losing the skills and benefits that come from meaningful relationships. prioritizing connection isn’t just good for our hearts—it’s essential for our minds. let’s make time for friends and rediscover the lost art of connecting. 🤝✨\n\n#friendshiprecession #neuroscience #mentalhealth #connectionmatters"

How the human brain makes these preference-based decisions is still debated in cognitive neuroscience. Classical models focus on the comparison mechanism that achieves the selection of the option with best expected value. Recent models suggest that estimates of option values are refined until reaching sufficient confidence in the considered choice. Neuroimaging studies in humans and electrophysiology studies in animals have gathered evidence that value and confidence estimates are both represented in the medial and lateral regions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here, we took advantage of electrodes implanted within the OFC of human patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (14 women, 12 men) to investigate whether value and confidence estimates can be dissociated in electrophysiology activity recorded during preference-based binary decisions. The overall value (likeability ratings summed over options) and choice confidence (selection probability of the chosen option) were identified in low-frequency (4–8 Hz) OFC activity. These value and confidence signals were time-locked to the decision, showed opposite signs of correlation, and were recorded in separate sites. This pattern of results is not consistent with the simulations of an attractor neural network model implementing a comparison of option values. However, it is compatible with the notion of a neural network generating sparse representations of option values and choice confidence estima",
    "summary": "how does your brain decide what you want—and how sure you feel about it? 🧠✨ new research using direct brain recordings in humans reveals that the orbitofrontal cortex (ofc) separately processes both the value we assign to choices and our confidence in those decisions. during preference-based decisions (like picking food from a menu), distinct low-frequency brain signals emerge for value and confidence, each in different ofc regions and with opposite patterns. this challenges older theories suggesting these signals are always intertwined, and instead supports the idea that our brains create unique pathways for how much we want something and how certain we are about wanting it. these findings are a major step forward for neuroscience, offering fresh insight into the neural roots of decision-making and self-assurance. \n\n#neuroscience #decisionmaking #brainresearch #ofc #confidence #value #cognitivescience"

A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions. Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving. We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands. We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (\nN\n= 37, 30 females). To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography. Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it. Spontaneous, as opposed to deliberate mind wandering, was particularly beneficial for extracting the probabilistic patterns hidden in the visual stream. Cortical oscillatory activity",
    "summary": "new research reveals that letting your mind wander during certain learning tasks isn’t always a bad thing—especially when it comes to picking up hidden patterns without even realizing it. 🧠✨ scientists found that spontaneous mind wandering actually boosted people’s ability to unconsciously learn probabilistic patterns, as shown by increased rhythmic brain activity on eeg. rather than harming all types of learning, zoning out sometimes helps the brain spot subtle regularities in our environment. this challenges the old idea that mind wandering is just a distraction and highlights its unique role in how our brains process information beneath the surface. these insights are especially relevant as neuroscience explores how different mental states shape learning and creativity.\n\n#neuroscience #mindwandering #brainwaves #learning #cognition"

In fact, imagining your future self may be one of the most psychologically healthy and motivating things you can do.\nThe Power of Future-Oriented Thinking\nFuture thinking is a form of mental time travel that allows you to imagine possibilities, outcomes, and goals. Unlike\nanxiety\n-driven worry, which tends to fixate on worst-case scenarios, healthy future thinking is purposeful, vivid, and constructive. It’s not about\nfantasy\n—it’s about using your\nimagination\nas a tool for\nmotivation\n,\nresilience\n, and well-being.\nIn fact, studies show that people who regularly think about the future tend to make better decisions in the present, from saving money to exercising more consistently [1]. When you can picture your future self clearly—whether it’s five minutes, five days, or five years from now—you’re more likely to make choices that benefit that version of you.\nSource: unsplash by chermiti Mohamed\nThe Future Isn’t Far Away—It’s Already Arriving\nWe often think of the future as something distant or abstract, but in reality, the future starts with your very next moment. Each decision you make today shapes the “you” that shows up tomorrow. When you practice asking yourself,\n“How can I make the next moment better?”\nthroughout the day, you begin to actively create a better future self in real time.\nFrom this perspective, the present is not just where you are—it’s the arrival point of the future you once imagined. Every moment becomes a bridge between where you are and where you want to go. You’re not passively waiting for life to happen—you’re participating in its creation. Your future self isn’t hypothetical. It’s a real version of you, being built right now, one choice at a time.\nFuture Thinking Builds Motivation and Meaning\nWhen you visualize meaningful goals, you create something psychologists call psychological distance—a tool that helps you rise above short-term impulses and focus on long-term rewards [2]. This ability to mentally “step back” from the moment helps you connect to deeper values and purpose, and fosters what’s known as eudaimonic well-being—the kind of\nhappiness\nrooted in growth, meaning, and personal fulfillment [3].\nOne study found that people who wrote about their “best possible future self” for just a few minutes a day experienced greater\noptimism\nand life satisfaction for weeks afterward [4]. What increased wasn’t just optimism—but also a sense of control and agency. When you believe your actions today influence your tomorrow, you’re far more likely to take those actions.\nTools From Future Directed Therapy: How to Think Forward\nFuture thinking isn’t just a concept—it’s a skill that can be practiced.\nFuture Directed\nTherapy\n(FDT)\n, is a therapeutic approach designed to help people shift out of rumination and reactivity and begin creating the life they want.\nHere are some foundational tools from FDT that can help you think forward more effectively:\nRecognizing and Redirecting Thought Patterns.\nFDT teaches you to become aware of when your thoughts are stuck in past regrets or current obstacles, and then redirect them toward desirable future outcomes. This shift breaks the cycle of\nlearned helplessness\nand fosters renewed hope.\nThe “What Do I Want?” Exercise.\nThis deceptively simple daily question helps train your brain to focus on what you’re moving toward, not what you’re trying to avoid. It builds clarity and solution-oriented thinking.\nCreating a Future Image.\nVisualize in vivid detail what you want your future to look like—not just the outcomes, but how you feel, act, and live day-to-day. Writing it down helps anchor your vision and fuels motivation.\nIntentional Action Lists.\nThese are like to-do lists with purpose.

The strength of this position is supposedly that it provides a middle ground between dualism and\nmaterialism\n.\nKurzweil likes panprotopsychism because it treats consciousness as a “fundamental force” in the universe that can be transformed by information-processing complexity found in brains and increasingly computers. This fits with his view that all that it will take to make computers conscious is to make them fast enough that they can exploit the proto-mental properties of matter.\nProblems of Panpsychism\nPanpsychism is an ancient view with five major problems:\nLack of evidence that atoms, rocks, and so on possess consciousness.\nLack of evidence that whatever gives consciousness to non-organisms also provides it to organisms.\nNo explanation of how simple consciousness in non-organisms could add up to the complex consciousness possessed by humans and other animals.\nNo specific explanations of how simple consciousness could produce the vast variety of human consciousness experiences, including perceptions, sensations, emotions, and abstractions such as a sense of self.\nAvailability of alternative neural explanations of consciousness, such as the\nGlobal Workspace Broadcasting\ntheory and the\nNBC\n(neural representation, binding, coherence, and\ncompetition\ntheory).\nPanprotopsychism faces similar problems.\nProblems of Panprotopsychism\nJust as we have no evidence that rocks, or atoms, or subatomic particles have bits of consciousness, we have absolutely no evidence for the existence of the required proto-mental properties. We do not have even the vaguest idea of what these properties might be like.\nA huge amount is known about the chemical, molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic mechanisms that operate in brains, and proto-mental properties are unconnected with these empirically supported hypotheses. Moreover, we have no evidence for the existence of proto-mental properties in organisms such as mammals and birds that do provide behavioral evidence of conscious experiences, such as pain.\nGiven this ignorance, no one can even begin to explain how proto-mental properties might give rise to consciousness in any entity, let alone the organisms that do have it. Mechanistic explanations, such as those found in\nneuroscience\n, derive regular changes from the interactions of connected parts, but no one has even the hint of a glimpse of a sketch of a story about how proto-mental properties could combine into either the precursors of consciousness or actual consciousness at its most primitive.\nEven more beyond the explanatory reach of panpsychism and panprotopsychism are the richness and variety of conscious experiences that occur in perception, sensation,\nemotion\n, and abstract thought. Thousands or millions of qualitatively different experiences are produced by different external and internal senses, emotional reactions, and abstractions. No one has a clue how the elementary consciousness of small objects, such as atoms, or their proto-mental properties, could combine into the opulence of animal consciousness.\nMoreover, the strange realm of the proto-mental may succumb to an infinite\nregress\n, if we need to posit an underlying proto-proto-mental level. Panprotopsychism has no real advantages over the evidence-free thesis of panpsychism. For both scientific and philosophical reasons, we are better off sticking to biology, chemistry, and physics to explain the psychological complexities of consciousness.\nNeuroscience Essential Reads\nThe 100-year-old Brain Disease That Could Come Back\nToday’s Been a Heck of a Week!\nThe NBC Theory of Consciousness\nFortunately, strong alternative explanations are becoming available, and the NBC theory in",
    "summary": "is the idea that everything—even atoms and rocks—has some form of consciousness making a comeback? a new twist, called panprotopsychism, suggests that all matter has \"proto-mental\" properties, precursors to consciousness. some tech thinkers even believe this could mean computers might one day be conscious too. but current neuroscience highlights big problems: there’s no evidence these proto-mental properties exist, no explanation of how they’d combine to create the rich, complex experiences we know as consciousness, and no scientific link to what we observe in the brain. with advances in neural theories like the global workspace and nbc models, researchers are finding more grounded, testable explanations for consciousness rooted in biology and chemistry. while the idea of a conscious universe is intriguing, neuroscience today is focusing on evidence-based models to unlock the mysteries of the mind. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #consciousness #mindscience #sciencenews"

Paradoxically, our ability to send a message across the globe in seconds has not made it easier to feel truly seen or understood. In fact, a survey of 20,000 U.S. adults show that nearly 50 percent of people report feeling lonely regularly. What’s driving this sense of isolation, and more important, how can we rediscover the sense of belonging that is essential to our well-being?\nBuilding Connections in a Lonely World\nSource: Christian Aeberhard for Heart-Based Medicine Foundation/Used With Permission\nWhy Belonging Matters: A Biological Imperative\nBelonging isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s wired into our very survival. As social creatures, our ancestors thrived in groups, relying on shared resources and mutual protection.\nEvolution has left its imprint—being connected to others triggers the release of\noxytocin\n, often called the “\nbonding\nhormone\n,” which reduces\nstress\nand fosters trust. Conversely, loneliness activates the brain’s threat response, making us hyper-aware of perceived dangers.\nThis is why loneliness isn’t just an emotional experience—it’s a health risk. Chronic loneliness has been linked to higher rates of\ndepression\n,\nanxiety\n, cardiovascular disease, and even a shortened lifespan. The science is clear: Belonging is as essential to our well-being as food or shelter.\nHow Modern Life Fosters Disconnection\nDespite the importance of connection, the structures of modern life often push us apart. Here are three key reasons why:\n1. The Illusion of Digital Connection\nWhile\nsocial media\npromises to bring us closer, it often does the opposite. Platforms encourage shallow interactions, like “likes” and comments, which can create a false sense of connection without the depth that true relationships require. Research shows that heavy social media use correlates with higher rates of loneliness and lower\nself-esteem\n.\n2. The Hustle Culture Mentality\nIn a society that glorifies busyness, relationships are often sidelined. The pressure to achieve and produce leaves little time for nurturing connections. Even when we do make time, our minds are often preoccupied with work or personal to-do lists, preventing genuine presence.\n3. A\nFear\nof Vulnerability\nModern life has also amplified the fear of rejection. When we scroll through curated social media feeds, it’s easy to believe everyone else has it all together. As a result, we hold back our true selves, fearing judgment or exclusion, which ironically deepens our sense of isolation.\nHow to Build Genuine Connections\nHand on heart, can you truly identify where you belong? Reclaiming a sense of belonging doesn’t happen overnight, but small, intentional steps can lead to profound changes. Here’s how to start:\n1. Connect with Yourself\nShifting your focus from the outer world to the inner world and asking yourself the question, “Who is the observer here?” gives you a much broader perspective on the definition of self. Connecting at this more profound level can help you feel more integrated and give you a deeper sense of belonging.\n2. Prioritize Face-to-Face Interaction\nThe richness of in-person communication cannot be overstated. Facial expressions, tone of voice, and\nbody language\nconvey emotional nuances that text messages cannot. To foster deeper connections, prioritize spending time with people in person, whether that means catching up with a friend over coffee or joining a local group.\n3. Foster Vulnerability\nTHE BASICS\nUnderstanding Loneliness\nTake our Social Anxiety Test\nFind a therapist near me\nTrue belonging requires showing up as your authentic self, imperfections and all. Sharing your struggles and fears might feel risky, but it also invites others to do the same. Vulnerability creates\nintimacy\nand signals trust, both of which are critical for building meaningful relationships.\n4. Practice Deep Listening\nListening deeply is a skill that’s often overlooked in a fast-paced world. Deep listening means listening with all of you, not just with your ears and mind. It means paying\nattention\nwith every cell of your body so that you hear not just what is said but also give credence to what is not being expressed verbally, physically, and emotionally. This practice communicates that you value the other person`s thoughts and emotions.\nLoneliness Essential Reads\nWhy Daily C",
    "summary": "in a world where we’re more “connected” than ever, nearly half of us still feel lonely. neuroscience shows that belonging isn’t just a nice feeling—it’s a biological need, as vital as food or shelter. when we connect, our brains release oxytocin, reducing stress and building trust. but chronic loneliness triggers our threat response, raising risks for depression, anxiety, and even heart disease.\n\nmodern life—endless scrolling, hustle culture, and fear of vulnerability—often keeps us apart. to truly belong, try these science-backed steps: connect with yourself on a deeper level, prioritize in-person time, show up authentically (imperfections and all), and practice deep listening. these small shifts can rewire our brains for connection and well-being.\n\nbelonging is a superpower—let’s nurture it, together. 🤝💛\n\n#neuroscience #belonging #mentalhealth #connection #wellbeing"

Learn when to trust your instincts.\nPosted\nApril 14, 2025\n|\nReviewed by Davia Sills\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nKey points\nIntuition stems from past experiences and pattern recognition, not just sudden insight.\nGut feelings work best when paired with facts, especially in high-stakes decisions.\nEmotions can cloud intuition—pause before trusting the gut in emotionally charged moments.\nThe decision to trust our gut feeling is easy if we are reaching into a bowl to choose a ticket for a door prize. Since we can’t lean on expertise, practice, or information, we move our hands around until a ticket “feels” right. We trust our gut. Besides, if we choose wrong, there are few, if any, consequences.\nBut suppose the decision has important consequences, and we have time to analyze our options—like choosing a business partner or life partner, starting or stopping fertility treatment, or leaving a job for a new one. Should we trust our gut or think twice?\nBoth, according to research findings.\nGut feelings\nmay seem like they come from thin air and are suddenly just there, but cognitive\nneuroscience\nresearch tells us that these feelings come from\npattern recognition\nand past experience. Apparently, our brains constantly collect and organize information to use when we have to make rapid decisions and send messages when they are needed to the neurons lining our gut, which is sometimes called the “second brain.” We may actually feel the messages as physical sensations in the pit of our stomach, warm flushes across our chest, or cold chills up our back.\nWhat we call “intuition,” then, is really part of an early alert system to help us avoid danger and steer us toward safety. It gives us our “first impressions,” “premonitions,” “unexplained\nanxiety\n,” “hunches,” “sixth sense,” and “good vibes.”\nBut are our instincts always right, and do they give us enough information for big decisions?\nMy gut feeling is that your answer would be “probably not,” and you’d be right. Gut feelings often give us more information about ourselves and our own past experiences than they do about our current situation. So, as the stakes of a decision become higher, so should the amount of information we collect beyond our immediate hunch or\nfirst impression\n.\nSuppose, for example, you are choosing a fertility practice. You not only want a clinic where you feel welcome and comfortable; you also want excellent outcomes. Both objective and subjective criteria count.\nThe same is true when we choose a therapist, a trainer, or a doula. They are relationships that should “feel right,” and our brain can identify\nmicroexpressions\nand nonverbal cues in two seconds, but we will also need credentials and references.\nBut suppose you’re selecting an accountant, a stockbroker, or a surgeon. Their performance record may not only be more important to us than our first impression; it may even override a negative first impression.\nAnd then there are gut feelings that may be misleading.\nHit the pause button if your intuition is about a very emotional decision. When emotions are high, it is easier to confuse people from the past with those in the present, and instead of reading the room accurately, we may be practicing wishful thinking.\nDon’t trust your\ndistrust\nif you are making a decision under pressure. You may let anxiety or fears about the future create negative first impressions and gut feelings in the present. Have you ever felt “bad vibes” from someone you later learned you really liked? I have.\nIf you are over-analyzing a decision or conflicted about a situation, relying on your gut feeling can give you some relief, but that’s all it is—a quick fix. Gut feelings are starting points, not final answers, so don’t force the big decisions or give your intuition too big a job.\nWhen a situation feels familiar, and your sixth sense tells you that you’ve been through this before, beware. You are more likely to have your intuition set on automatic pilot and miss clues and cues that could help you navigate this new situation.\nSo, when you have a “hunch” or “suspicion” that something is not right, check it out. Your reactions are coming from your valuable past observations. And when your intuition or sixth sense tells you something is just right, double-check also, just to be sure. Understanding how your gut feelings operate can help you value them and use them wisely.\nReferences\n(1) Behav Neurosci. 2022 Jul 5;16:929332. doi: 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.929332\nGut Signals and Gut Feelings: Science at the Interface of Data and Beliefs\nPeter Holzer.

Advocates claim benefits such as enhanced\ncreativity\n, improved mood, increased focus, and relief from\ndepression\nand\nanxiety\n.\nRecent clinical trials fail to confirm the hype, at least pharmacologically, and suggest these benefits might not stem from the substances themselves.\nInstead, they may be driven by belief. The more rigorous studies indicate that microdosing’s effects could be comparable to those of a placebo.\nThe \"Citizen Science\" Origin Story\nPsychologist James Fadiman, who began studying psychedelics in the early 1960s, ignited the modern microdosing movement by collecting thousands of self-reported experiences starting in the early 2010s. Focusing on subtle, everyday shifts in mood, focus, and creativity, he emphasized the practice of “citizen science” (public participation in scientific research to enhance knowledge).\nIn his latest book with Jordan Gruber,\nMicrodosing for Healing, Health, and Enhanced Performance\n(2024), Fadiman shares patterns from over a decade of this citizen science. He asserts that the “reported and perceived changes in enhanced capacities and health conditions far exceed the possibility of just being explained by placebo and expectation effects.”\nWhat the Science Says So Far: The Jury Is Still Out\nRecent placebo-controlled studies have cast doubt on the pharmacological efficacy of microdosing psychedelics, suggesting that observed benefits may largely stem from participants’ expectations.\nFor instance, a self-blinding study involving 191 participants found that both microdose and placebo groups reported similar improvements in psychological well-being, indicating a strong\nplacebo effect\n(Szigeti et al., 2021).\nSkeptics of microdosing may find further confirmation in a comprehensive review of 19 placebo-controlled studies on LSD and psilocybin microdosing (Polito & Liknaitzky, 2024). The authors found that microdosing can lead to subtle changes in mood,\ncognition\n, and brain activity, but showed little consistent evidence of real-world benefits like enhanced creativity or well-being.\nEnthusiasts looking at the same study might note the dose-dependent effects and measurable physiological changes as signs of genuine impact. Polito & Liknaitzky themselves identify limitations in the studies so far, since they were all short, small, and focused on healthy participants, which might not reflect real-world use. The review concludes it’s still too soon to tell and calls for longer, better-designed trials, especially in clinical populations.\nThese discrepancies underscore the need for further research to understand the mechanisms at play and determine the true efficacy of microdosing practices. Fortunately, a number of clinical trials are underway—and even the current findings offer insights into how belief, intention, and context influence healing.\nThe Placebo Effect Is Often Misunderstood\nPlacebo is often misunderstood as being “fake,” but\nneuroscience\nis showing otherwise. When you expect healing, your brain may release\ndopamine\n, reduce cortisol, and change how it interprets pain, mood, and\nemotion\n(Benedetti, 2014). Belief is biochemistry.\nEven more curiously, placebos can work even when people know they’re taking them. Open-label placebo studies show that participants who are told they’re taking an inert pill still report real improvements. This suggests that belief, intention, and ritual may be more central to healing than we’ve assumed—and may help explain the microdosing phenomenon.\nMicrodosing, Meaning, and Mindset\nPerhaps microdosing’s greatest gift so far is not what it “does,” but what it reflects: the power of\nattention\n, intention, and self-authorized change. For many, it provides hope after other healing methods have fallen short.\nMedical anthropologist Daniel Moerman coined the term \"\nmeaning response\"\nto describe how our interpretations of a treatment—rather than its pharmacological content—can shape its effects. In this sense, microdosing may be as much about\nnarrative\nas it is about neurology.\nPsychedelics Essential Reads\nMy Psilocybin Journey: Healed Trauma Alone In Nature\nSpiritually Bypassing Hard Feelings\nFrom choosing a substance to microdosing to journaling ",
    "summary": "microdosing psychedelics—taking tiny, sub-perceptual doses of substances like lsd or psilocybin—has captured mainstream attention for its supposed mood, creativity, and focus boosts. but new research shows these benefits may be less about the drugs and more about our beliefs. recent neuroscience studies suggest microdosing often performs no better than a placebo, with intention, ritual, and expectation playing a powerful role in perceived effects. the brain’s response to belief can trigger real biochemical changes—meaning the “placebo effect” isn’t just in your head. as research continues, microdosing highlights how mindset, meaning, and the stories we tell ourselves can shape our healing journey. 🌱🧠\n\n#neuroscience #microdosing #placeboeffect #mentalhealth #mindsetmatters"

While framed as a step toward addressing a public health issue, the plan’s foundation is scientifically weak. Without a rigorous longitudinal, population-based design and an understanding of the genetic and biopsychosocial complexities of autism, the plan is likely to mislead, misallocate resources, and ultimately fail.\nThe Flaws of Chart Reviews and Retrospective Data\nChart reviews depend on existing medical records, which vary in quality and often lack standardized diagnosis or symptom severity measures. While retrospective studies may identify correlations, they cannot establish causality. These studies are particularly limited in developmental disorders like autism, where the timing of symptom onset, environmental exposures, and early-life variables are essential. Any analysis utilizing this data is built on shaky ground.\nRetrospective designs are also susceptible to recall\nbias\n, selection bias, and missing data—all of which undermine validity. They frequently overrepresent children who have already been diagnosed and treated within specific healthcare systems, thereby excluding marginalized or undiagnosed populations. This results in an incomplete picture of autism's diverse presentations and origins.\nAutism Is Not One Thing—It’s Many\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly heterogeneous. It is not caused by a single gene or exposure but likely by the complex interaction of hundreds of genes and environmental factors. Current genomic research shows that autism involves both rare de novo mutations and common polygenic risk variants (Sandin et al., 2014). No two individuals with autism have the same genetic profile.\nFor instance, mutations in CHD8, SHANK3, and SCN2A genes have been associated with autism, as well as with intellectual disability, epilepsy, or even a lack of clinical symptoms, depending on the individual’s genetic background and environment (Bourgeron, 2015). Chart reviews cannot account for this level of nuance.\nMultifinality and Equifinality: The Genetic Maze\nMultifinality refers to the phenomenon where the same genetic variation can lead to multiple outcomes, while equifinality indicates that different pathways can result in the same condition. These concepts are essential for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. A pseudoscientific approach that disregards this complexity is misguided and risks perpetuating simplistic narratives that may stigmatize families or generate false hopes.\nGenetic risk is probabilistic, not deterministic. For instance, having a\nsibling\nwith autism increases the risk, but it is not predictive. Environmental factors such as prenatal exposures, parental age, and early-life\nstress\ndynamically interact with genetic susceptibilities. A thorough investigation must account for these layers.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Autism?\nTake our Autism Test\nFind a therapist to help with autism\nThe Need for a Longitudinal, Biopsychosocial Approach\nOnly a longitudinal, population-based study can begin to answer the question of autism's origins. Such studies recruit a large cohort of babies at birth (or even prenatally) and follow them over time, collecting biological, psychological, social, and environmental data. This enables researchers to track development and identify risk and\nresilience\nfactors.\nExamples of rigorous longitudinal studies include:\nThe Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)\nhas tracked more than 100,000 pregnancies since 1999 and identified associations between prenatal factors and later neurodevelopmental outcomes (Magnus et al., 2006).\nThe Autism Birth Cohort Study (ABC)\n, nested within MoBa, has provided valuable data linking genetic variants with early behavioral markers of ASD (Stoltenberg et al., 2010).\nThe Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI)\nfocuses on infants at high risk for autism and examines environmental exposures,\nepigenetic\nmarkers, and early signs of ASD (Fallin et al., 2013).\nGeneration R Study\nin the Netherlands, tracks more than 9,000 children from fetal life onward and has provided insights into early brain development and\npsychiatric\nrisk (Jaddoe et al., 2012).\nSEED (Study to Explore E",
    "summary": "the search for a single cause of autism is missing the mark. autism is a complex, diverse condition shaped by hundreds of genes and countless environmental factors—no one pathway or “smoking gun” explains it all. current government plans relying on chart reviews and retrospective data just can’t capture this complexity, risking oversimplification and misdirection of resources. real progress in understanding autism’s roots comes from rigorous, long-term studies that follow individuals over years, collecting biological, psychological, and social data. these approaches embrace the true diversity of the autism spectrum and move us closer to meaningful answers and support. 🧬✨\n\n#autism #neuroscience #science #mentalhealth #research #inclusion"

Hyman Ph.D.\nA Neuroscientist’s Guide to Psychology\nCognition\nWhy You Can’t Always Believe What People Say or Animals Do\nCognitive compensation can hide underlying pathology in the brain.\nPosted\nApril 10, 2025\n|\nReviewed by Jessica Schrader\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nKey points\nCognitive compensation masks brain pathology and detecting it may be key to fighting Alzheimer's disease.\nPeople are not aware of cognitive compensation.\nNew findings reveal cognitive compensation in the anterior cingulate cortex of rats.\nMy parents both practiced holistic psychology, but were strongly influenced by\npsychoanalysis\n. This was always most apparent in their constant back-and-forth conjectures about what might underlie different patients' feelings and actions. I know they obviously listened to their patients, but what they would convey in talks around the dinner table was often their views of the patient’s motivating factors and not what the patients themselves would say. Thinking back to these observations, I’m reminded of something I think about a lot in my own research.\nI too am motivated to understand the root causes of behaviors, but for different reasons. I’m interested in cognitive compensation, or when the brain uses different ways to accomplish tasks. This is of great importance for long developing pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where it’s thought patients unknowingly utilize cognitive compensation.\nAD pathology begins decades before symptoms are detected, but unfortunately, most AD diagnoses don’t happen until very late in life (mean age=74), and at this point there are no treatments that can stop the disease's progressive march to morbidity. The problem is that people in their 40s and 50s who might develop the disease 30 years later don’t have any cognitive problems. Neuropsychological tests don’t find deficits and day to day life is normal. The individuals themselves have no idea that they have underlying pathology slowly accruing in their brains or that they’re using cognitive compensation. However, this does not mean that their brains are working the same as they were before and this is where the idea of cognitive or neural compensation comes in. Their brains are finding different ways to perform the same tasks, or they are adapting. If we can find a way to detect cognitive compensation during this period, then we might be able to target developing neurodegenerative pathology before it’s too late.\nIn my lab, we employ an array of methods to create neuropathology in the brains of mice and rats and then we sample the activity of neuronal networks in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus, two areas affected early in AD progression. We have the animals complete different behavioral tasks and then relate this activity to behavior to understand how information is processed in the brain.\nIn our rodent models, we use behavioral tests (often mazes), while neuropsychologists use batteries of cognitive tests, but in both cases what we can measure (rodents: behavior, humans: test results) is at the macro level. Cognitive compensation helps to solve these macro-level problems and thus, the\nmemory\nand cognitive tests find no deficits or the rats and mice find the reward at the end of the maze. If we think about rodent behavior as equivalent to what a patient says, then the neuronal information processing is the psychologist’s insight into the underlying mental processes. And just like my parents would often convey, sometimes the true answers are quite different from what the patients would say.\nIn terms of our data, sometimes the information conveyed by neurons is not consistent with the behavior of the animals. This has never been clearer than in a new study we have published in the Journal of\nNeuroscience\n(Bhasin et al., 2025). To understand cognitive compensation in early AD, we avoided any of the umpteen Alzheimer’s animal models and instead explored a leading AD risk factor. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that affects nearly 800 million people worldwide and infers a 65% greater likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease. While not all patients with type 2 diabetes will get AD, nearly all AD patients have trouble regulating insulin. Some have even suggested a more direct link arguing AD is type 3 diabetes or “diabetes of the brain,” since clearance of amyloid beta (one of the major protein pathologies of AD) is mediated by insulin signaling (Nguyen, Ta, Nguyen,Nguyen, & Giau, 2020).\nIn our task, both diabetic and healthy control animals were accurate, however, we found that their brains were working differently, providing evidence of cognitive compensation. In healthy controls, the strongest activity states occurred at the two reward sites. This is not surprising since this location is the most salient on the maze and the most important for task success. However",
    "summary": "our actions and words don’t always reveal what’s really happening in our brains 🧠. new neuroscience research shows that even when people or animals seem to perform normally, their brains may be compensating for hidden problems—a process called cognitive compensation. this is especially relevant for conditions like alzheimer’s, where the brain quietly adapts for years before symptoms ever appear. recent findings in rats reveal that animals with risk factors like type 2 diabetes completed tasks just as well as healthy ones, but their brains used different strategies to succeed. this means outward behavior can mask underlying changes, making early detection of brain diseases tricky. understanding and identifying cognitive compensation could open doors to catching neurodegenerative diseases much earlier—before they become irreversible. trust the science: sometimes, what you see isn’t the whole story. 🕵️‍♂️\n\n#neuroscience #alzheimers #brainhealth #cognitivecompensation #sciencenews"

Some are so small we hardly notice them: coffee or tea, sweater or jacket, reply now or later. Others feel like they split the road of our lives in two: leave or stay, speak up or stay quiet, change careers or hold the line. But big or small, conscious or automatic,\ndecision-making\nis the very fabric of being alive.\nThe decisions we make shape who we are. They determine whether we’re living in alignment with our values or drifting away, whether we’re leading or following, connecting or avoiding. Each choice is a micro-expression of our\nidentity\n—and over time, they add up to a life.\nEvery choice reflects a complex interplay between biology, experience,\nemotion\n, and environment. Behind each one is a choreography of brain regions, memories, bodily signals, and pressures. Decisions aren’t just what we do—they’re how we move through the world, moment by moment.\nThe Brain’s Decision-Making Network\nSeveral key brain regions work together when making decisions:\nPrefrontal cortex (PFC):\nThe “executive” center evaluates options and inhibits impulses.\nAmygdala:\nFlags threats and drives gut responses.\nStriatum and basal ganglia:\nTrack rewards and help automate behaviours.\nHippocampus:\nSupports\nmemory\nand simulates future outcomes.\nInsula:\nMonitors internal bodily states and risk perception.\nThese regions toggle between logic and emotion. A quick lunch choice may barely activate the PFC. But deciding to quit a job or end a relationship lights up nearly the whole system.\nMyelin and Mental Efficiency\nThe fatty sheath that wraps around neural axons, myelin, determines how fast signals travel between regions. The better insulated the pathways, the more coordinated your decisions can be.\nIn\nadolescence\n, prefrontal connections are still developing. This helps explain why teens can be impulsive. Over time, stronger myelination supports better regulation and planning.\nMyelin can change even in adulthood. Chronic\nstress\nhas been shown to reduce myelin in flexible thinking circuits, while\nfear\ncan increase it in defensive ones.\nThe Influence of Genes and Experience\nEach of us has a unique decision-making profile shaped in part by our\ngenes\n. But it’s not just which genes we inherit—it’s how they’re expressed.\nDopamine\n-related genes affect impulsivity and novelty-seeking.\nSerotonin-related genes shape threat sensitivity.\nOther genes, like MAOA, affect emotion regulation and planning.\nThese genetic influences are meaningful but not deterministic. Experience and environment play powerful roles through\nepigenetics\n.\nHow Context Shapes the Brain\nStress, adversity, and\ntrauma\ncan change brain function at the molecular level. In difficult environments, the brain adapts to stay alert—but this survival mode comes at a cost.\nChronic stress can lead to epigenetic changes that reduce flexibility and promote reactivity. Over time, people may become more prone to impulsive or habitual decisions.\nHowever, research shows that positive environmental factors can reverse or buffer many of these effects. Supportive relationships, in particular, have a powerful effect on stress reactivity and emotion regulation. Even one caring adult can reduce the long-term impact of trauma.\nIn adults, social support, exercise,\nnutrition\n, and\nmindfulness\nhelp strengthen brain circuits tied to\nemotional regulation\nand flexible thinking. Physical activity increases BDNF, a molecule that supports learning and neuroplasticity. These practices also influence gene expression, reducing stress markers and enhancing growth-related ones.\nDecision-Making Essential Reads\nAiming Off: Could Shifting Your Target Improve Accuracy?\nHow High Performers Overcome Decision Fatigue\nOur past may shape our wiring, but our present context influences how we use it.\nFree Will and the Capacity to Choose\nIf decisions arise from neural circuits shaped by genes, stress, and past experiences, can we really call them\nfree\n?\nFamous\nneuroscience\nstudies suggest brain activity can predict a choice seconds before we’re aware of it. But these findings relate mostly to trivial decisions—and don’t negate our ability to reflect and override impulses.\nMany philosophers and scientist",
    "summary": "every decision we make—big or small—shapes not just our behavior, but our brains and our very identity. 🧠✨ neuroscience now shows that choices are the result of a dynamic dance between brain regions, emotions, memories, and our environment. while genetics and early experiences influence how we decide, our brains remain flexible: positive habits, supportive relationships, and mindful practices can rewire decision-making circuits, even in adulthood. chronic stress or trauma can make us more reactive, but resilience and growth are possible. the latest research highlights that free will isn’t fixed; it’s a trainable skill. every choice becomes a building block for who we are and who we can become. your brain is always changing—choose with intention. 🌱\n\n#neuroscience #decisionmaking #mentalhealth #neuroplasticity #growthmindset"

How could there still be half the week left when it feels like this week has already lasted so long? And it extends to the longer timescales too. These last few months have felt like years. How is it only April? I know I’m not alone in feeling this. It seems every day I see a different version of the 30 Rock or grizzled captain\nmemes\n. You know the ones: “It’s been a hell of a week.” “Uh, Captain, it’s only Wednesday!” How are we all experiencing a disconnect between our own sense of time passing and how much time has actually passed? It’s like some sort of collective temporal illusion.\nWhy is this happening to us all? The best explanation for this psychological phenomenon comes from basic\nneuroscience\nresearch. The short answer is our brains track time by counting experiences, and each day lately has been filled with a barrage of shattering news briefs. Each new attack on our systems, each new mass firing of federal officials, each new volley in the trade war, each office/institute/department closed, each new stock market drop, each new assault on our rights, each new kidnapping — all of them are different experiences in our brains. Each one is a different, new experience, and each experience keeps telling our brains that time is moving forward, but then we look at our calendars and see that time is still going at its normal pace. There’s a serious disconnect there.\nTo understand the science behind this phenomenon, work by my lab and others has begun to provide insight. It’s been found that the more experiences we have in a period of time, the more the clock moves forward. My lab found evidence of such a clock in the anterior cingulate cortex (Wirt et al., 2024), while others have shown similar effects in the hippocampus (Khatib et al., 2023). What’s been found is best described as “drift,” where neural signals become less similar the more separated they are in time. But, it’s not time passing that drives the networks to drift, it’s individual experiences.\nIn our lab, we examined the activity of large groups of ACC neurons, or ensembles, while animals completed a repetitive task. Animals would complete over 200 trials in total, but some animals worked fast and some worked slow, just like humans. Interestingly, all animals worked at their own consistent paces, though. When we examined the ACC activity during each trial, we found that the brain states were changing as trials were accumulated. This was the drift. Next, we leveraged the fact that animals worked at different paces and used\nmachine learning\ntechniques. We were able to determine that the number of trials, and not clock time, was related to the drift. Thus, experiences, or trials, were moving the networks forward.\nSuch activity is very useful for creating a unique temporal context for each event. This is of great importance when performing a series of tasks that are similar but each still distinct. In the lab, we see this in working\nmemory\ntests where subjects are shown an example object, then, after a delay, shown the example plus another object and told to choose which was the example. Unique brain states on each trial can help distinguish the example on one trial from the examples on previous trials. This is also thought to be important for autobiographical memory, helping to form distinct memories for multiple experiences that occur in the same physical context. Indeed, both the ACC and hippocampus are very important for working and autobiographical memory, and we think these drifting signals underlie these functions.\nSo, the good news is that our brains are working as they should. Our lives have natural rhythms or paces that we all get accustomed to. There’s a reason that certain months—I’m looking at you, September—seem to last forever. Lots of events usually happen in September, especially if you are in academia and have school-age kids. Interestingly, this phenomenon can also work backwards, with our brains telling us not much time has passed, because little has happened, but the calendar says otherwise. We all remember the six-month-long March of 2020, when the whole world stopped.\nI don’t have a solution to this problem right now, but it might be a good idea to take some days, or weeks, off fro",
    "summary": "ever feel like a single week drags on forever? neuroscience shows our brains count time by experiences—not by the clock. when life is packed with news, changes, or stress, each event makes our brains feel like more time has passed, even though the calendar says otherwise. this “temporal illusion” is rooted in how networks in our brain, like the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, create unique states for every experience—a process called drift. this helps us keep memories distinct, but it also makes busy weeks feel endless. so if it feels like april’s lasted a year, your brain’s just doing its job. 🧠⏳\n\n#neuroscience #psychology #timedistortion #memory #brainfacts"

It’s a narrative we choose to rewrite.\nReal change begins when we make meaning from what broke us.\nThe Natural\nSource: Tri-Star Pictures\nI’m a bit of a romantic. That might not seem like a high-risk confession, but in my line of work—where coolheaded objectivity and calculated disruption are the norm—romanticism can make you vulnerable. Especially when it clouds judgment with the illusion of destiny. Still, I find myself drawn to the emotional undercurrents of human\nresilience\n, the stories we tell ourselves to move forward—or keep ourselves stuck.\nTake one of my favorite films,\nThe Natural\n. It’s a romantic homage to baseball and redemption. In one of its most quoted scenes, Iris Gaines visits Roy Hobbs in the hospital and tells him,\n“You know, I believe we have two lives. The life we learn with and the life we live with after that.”\nIn the film’s version of the American myth, Roy overcomes injury, returns to the field, and wins the game.\nBut if you read the original novel by Bernard Malamud, you know that’s not how the story ends. In the book, Roy’s\ncareer\nis left in ruins after being accused of throwing a game. No redemption arc. No victory. Just disgrace. It’s not just tragic, it’s Kafkaesque—a reminder that life doesn’t always reward lessons learned, or even offer closure.\nLately, I’ve been haunted by that notion of “two lives.” Why do some people seem to cross that threshold into a wiser, more adaptive second life, while others remain stuck in the first? What determines who gets to live “the life we live with after that”?\nSome people do learn from failure. They recalibrate. They take ownership of the wreckage and rebuild. Others don’t. They get caught in the loop—blaming, rationalizing, railing against a system that may or may not be to blame. That’s not to say structural barriers aren’t real. They are. But so is\nself-deception\n—the myth that the “system” is always the reason we can’t move forward.\nSo, the deeper question becomes:\nDo our experiences really change our ideologies—or more accurately, our personal mythologies?\nIt’s tempting to turn here to social psychology or\nneuroscience\n. We know from research that people often double down on beliefs even when faced with disconfirming evidence. Cultural\ncognition\ntheory shows that people interpret facts in ways that reinforce their group\nidentity\n(Kahan, 2013). And\ntrauma\nresearch tells us that adversity doesn’t automatically produce growth: Some people adapt; others struggle for years (Bonanno, 2004).\nBut let’s stay in the narrative for a moment.\nThink of Fantine in the musical\nLes Misérables\n. In “I Dreamed a Dream,” she sings not just of heartbreak, but of collapsed meaning. She believed in a God. Then, she believed in a man. Both, she feels, abandoned her. Her tragedy isn’t just what happened to her; it’s the dissonance between what she believed and what she endured. That dissonance, unprocessed, is what ultimately destroys her.\nIt’s not the experience alone that breaks us. It’s the failure to revise the myth.\nThe Myth Gap\nWe all carry a personal narrative—what psychologist Dan McAdams calls a “narrative identity.” It’s the evolving story we tell ourselves about who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going. For some, those stories are redemptive: Mistakes are transformed into growth, suffering into strength. For others, they’re what McAdams calls “contamination stories”: A bad event spoils everything, and the story can’t move forward.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Resilience?\nTake our Resilience Test\nFind a therapist near me\nThe gap between what we expected and what we experienced creates a rupture. Whether or not we learn to rewrite the story may determine whether we get a second life—or stay stuck in the first.\nLearning to Rewrite\nTake Robert Downey Jr., a contemporary example of someone who seemed stuck in the first life for years. There were legal troubles,\naddiction\n, a career in ruins. But somewhere along the line, the story changed. He got clean. He rebuilt. He didn’t erase the first life; he repurposed it. His success didn’t come from pretending the wreckage never happened. It came from\nreframing it\n.\nNot everyone has access to the same resources or opportunities. But research does suggest that the ability to\nreframe personal narratives\nis a powerful driver of resilience. In one study, people who interpreted adversity as a challenge to grow were more likely to recover and thrive than those who saw themselves as permanently damaged (Tedeschi & Ca",
    "summary": "we all live two lives: the one we learn with, and the one we live after. 🌱 some people grow from failure and rewrite their story, while others stay trapped in old narratives. neuroscience shows our brains often cling to beliefs, even when faced with new facts, and trauma research reminds us that adversity alone doesn’t guarantee growth—what matters is how we make meaning from it. resilience isn’t automatic; it’s about reframing our personal myths and choosing to move forward, not just surviving but transforming. your second life starts when you decide to rewrite the story. ✨\n\n#resilience #neuroscience #growthmindset #mentalhealth #selfdiscovery"

This would combine two powerful proven ways to reduce stress and\nanxiety\n, boost\ncreativity\nand problem-solving, and process difficult emotions: journaling and being outside. Whether you’re sitting in a park or walking down the street, take a few moments to observe the world around you and jot down your thoughts and observations. You could even spend some time watching animals.\nOne animal I like to watch is ants. It's fascinating and relaxing at the same time. Depending on where you are there may be a variety of species of ants, but they have some common features. Many ant species collaborate to build nests, care for young, and forage efficiently. They communicate chemically and watching them travel along their \"roads,\" make space for others, or help a struggling ant friend are just a few of the things you might observe. When I watch ants, I'm always reminded that small, consistent, individual effort and actions can make a big impact.\nIf you decide to journal outside, what else do you notice? The way the squirrels run around flicking their tails, the sound of birds in the distance, or the fragrant smell after a short summer rain? You don’t need to be in a remote forest to appreciate nature’s subtle beauty. If you prefer structured prompts to help guide your journaling, check out my Rooted in Nature\nworkbook, which complements the Audible course with reflection activities to deepen your connection.\n2. Practice Mindfulness Outdoors\nMeditation\nin some form has been part of human culture for at least 5,000 years. In the 20th century, meditation gained global popularity and is now part of our everyday vernacular. It is more recently that science has validated what ancient societies already knew about the benefits of meditation. From reducing stress and helping to regulate emotions to improving brain power and physically reshaping the brain, the life enhancing outcomes of meditation cannot be overstated. Whether for mental clarity, emotional balance, or overall well-being, meditation remains a powerful tool—rooted in ancient tradition and validated by modern\nneuroscience\n.\nWhile some Indigenous cultures practice multi-day meditation experiences, you don’t need to embark on a multi-day trek to practice\nmindfulness\n. Simply sit or stand outside and take a few minutes to focus on your breath. Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of nature—maybe the rustle of leaves or the chirping of a nearby bird. In the Audible course I introduce micro-meditations, while the workbook offers more traditional meditation activities.\n3. Become Part of a Nature Community\nWe are an inherently social species and wired for connection. Chronic\nloneliness\nis a significant public health concern, increasing the risk of heart disease,\ndepression\n, and anxiety. Getting involved with like-minded people for a common purpose can be a powerful and meaningful way to reconnect and strengthen a sense of belonging. You don’t need a lab coat or a science degree to make an important contribution to science. Participatory science—also known as community science or citizen science—invites everyday people to collect data, make observations, and ask questions that help researchers better understand the world. Whether you’re monitoring local bird populations, measuring rainfall, or documenting when flowers bloom, your observations can become part of something much bigger than yourself. ",
    "summary": "feeling stressed or disconnected? neuroscience shows that spending time in nature can boost your mood, lower anxiety, and even reshape your brain for the better 🌱✨. you don’t need a remote forest—just step outside, start a nature journal, or mindfully observe the world around you. even watching ants or listening to birds can spark creativity and calm. want to connect deeper? join a local nature group or participate in community science projects. small, mindful moments outdoors can lead to big changes in mental well-being. let's nurture our minds by reconnecting with the natural world 🌳\n\n#mentalhealth #natureheals #mindfulness #neuroscience #wellbeing"

Loops and setbacks often signal deeper learning, not regression.\nWhat feels like a detour may be the path. Progress sometimes looks like dancing, not marching.\nSometimes the path forward isn’t straight—it’s a turn you didn’t expect, leading somewhere even better.\nSource: Wasabi Publicity | Adobe | Michael Brown | Used with permission\nLet’s be honest—progress doesn’t come in a straight line. Not for me, not for you, not for anyone. I used to think that if I just worked hard enough and stuck to the plan, I’d land exactly where I wanted.\nBut life doesn’t care about your timeline.\nIllness, betrayal,\nburnout\n, job loss, natural disasters—any of these can flip your world. And sometimes, it’s the things that don’t happen—the\ngoals\nunmet, the relationships that stall—that require us to pause and reassess.\nHere’s what I know for sure: Real progress isn’t about forcing your way through. It’s about knowing when to pivot.\nIf you’ve thought you’d be further along by now, consider that you’re not off course. Perhaps, you’re just being asked to shift. These three takeaways may help you see that pivot as part of the path, not a detour.\nA Pivot Isn’t a Failure—It’s Feedback\nYou don’t have to keep doing something just because you once believed it was the right thing. A pivot isn’t a sign that you’ve failed. It’s a sign that you’re paying\nattention\n.\nThis has been true in my own life, especially recently. After Hurricane Helene devastated the North Carolina homestead I was building for\nretirement\n, I pivoted again when the Green River Gamelands—where I’ve lived and worked for 20 years—came under threat from wildfires. That land was my haven. I moved there to whitewater kayak and, more recently, to mountain bike—two outdoor adventures that helped me heal from\nC-PTSD\n.\nAnd yet, instead of gripping harder, I released. My husband, our dog, and I are now setting off on a cross-country mountain biking journey in a van. It’s not the future I imagined—but the pivot excites me more than the retirement\ndreams\ndid.\nI wonder how you too will be surprised by your pivots?\nFeelings May Be Valid But Let Facts Make the Call\nWhen you choose to pivot, expect a surge of\nemotion\n. You might experience\nfear\n,\nguilt\n, sadness, or even\nshame\n. That’s normal. In fact,\nneuroscience\nshows that uncertainty and change activate the amygdala, the brain’s fear center, which can cloud your ability to assess situations clearly.\nEmotions may give you important signals; don’t let them be your sole decision-makers. I’ve got two tools that may help you navigate more clearly. These tools are: cognitive reappraisal and interoceptive awareness.\nInteroceptive awareness\nrefers to your ability to perceive internal cues like pain, fatigue, or calm. You know when you instinctively “feel off” and may even say that to a friend or family member? This is what I’m talking about. Research links this type of awareness to better\nemotional regulation\nand\ndecision-making\n, so pay attention to it. Don’t discount it. Many of us do, but that is a mistake.\nCognitive reappraisal\nhelps you reinterpret a situation from an expanded perspective, providing the mental flexibility that supports pivoting. It reduces emotional distress. Also called “reframing,” it helps me recognize that although I might be\nstressed\nif my mother-in-law criticizes me, perhaps she simply wants to spend more time with her son, my husband. Then her comments bother me less; I can see that what's behind them is her love of her son. Reappraisal enables you to adapt more quickly to new circumstances. To reduce your emotional distress and develop an interpretation that empowers you, focus on the facts, first.\nHere’s how you check the facts:\nWhat’s your body telling you about the situation? In other words, what can you see, smell, touch, hear, or taste? Ground yourself in reality.\nAre your routines sustainable? If you aren't taking care of yourself, you will constantly be in a state of survival.\nIs your energy consistently depleted or restored? Many times the emotions we place on a situation can distort and overwhelm. That can drain you.\nRemember, progress doesn’t always come with a dramatic shift. Recognize that you need change. Then take a steady, informed step forward from facts.\nForget Linear. Growth Loops, Dips, and Doubles Back\nProgress isn’t linear—it’s looping, spiraling, iterative (evolving). You come back to the same lessons with more\nwisdom\n. You take two steps forward, one sideways, and maybe a stum",
    "summary": "life rarely goes as planned—and that’s not a failure, it’s feedback. neuroscience shows that when we face setbacks or unexpected changes, our brains react with fear and uncertainty, but these moments can actually lead to deeper growth. by tuning into your body’s signals (interoceptive awareness) and reframing your perspective (cognitive reappraisal), you can make choices grounded in reality, not just emotion. progress isn’t a straight line; it’s a dance of loops, pivots, and surprises. next time you’re forced to pivot, remember: it might be the path you needed all along. embrace the journey, trust your brain’s adaptability, and let each turn teach you something new. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #growthmindset #resilience #mentalhealth #pivot"

Scott Gornto\nThe Stories We Tell Ourselves\nSelf-Talk\nOvercoming Self-Limiting Beliefs\nRecognize your inner critic, uncover its origins, and reclaim your self-worth.\nPosted\nApril 10, 2025\n|\nReviewed by Margaret Foley\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nTHE BASICS\nFind a therapist near me\n“You’re not worthy.”\n“You’re not enough.”\n“No one is going to like you.”\n“You’re broken beyond repair.”\nCan you relate? Does this sound like the negative narrator in your mind?\nAs a psychotherapist for nearly 25 years, I’ve noticed a pattern. Individuals struggle with their worth based on self-limiting belief systems. These negative, internal narratives influence and shape their lives in unhealthy ways. For example, these systems are one of the main drivers of\naddiction\n.\nIf you relate, how can you address unhealthy self-judgment and take steps toward healing today?\nI’ve identified three broad steps.\nStep 1: Accept That These Are Stories\nFirst, name and identify the source of these beliefs as a\nstoryteller\n. From a\nneuroscience\nperspective, our brain naturally tells stories. Many of these narratives are\nfear\n-based, negative, and self-deprecating, and they’re influenced by your past, present, and future. So, first, recognize, and become aware of your negative\nself-talk\nand beliefs telling you a story about your life.\nStep 2: Consider What Gives the Stories Their Power\nThe second step is to explore where your storyteller got its voice; who or what has empowered that internal storyteller to disparage you? I tend to think we all have a negative narrator, a critical voice in our head. Psychotherapist and author Rick Carson calls it a “monster of the mind”: “Your mind is a giant warehouse filled with remnants and representations of your direct experience: snapshots, beliefs [opinions to which you’ve developed loyalty], assumptions, concepts, memories, wild ideas, and foregone conclusions. In the warehouse, hoping you’ll stop by, is a monster—the monster of the mind.” The monster’s goal is to make you miserable and divert you from your moment-to-moment experience. Your job is to notice him trying to pull you away from the present moment. He’ll do everything possible to get you to focus on regrets, memories, what ifs, and, of course, believing that you aren’t enough.\nThe more you become aware of this internal, negative storytelling monster, and create a sliver of space between your thoughts and your present experience, the more you will find peace. Over time, you’ll also see yourself in a more positive light.\nNegative self-beliefs can also stem from:\ntraumatic\nevents, unmet\nchildhood\nneeds, chemical or\nhormonal\nimbalance,\ncareer\nfailure,\ndivorce\n, or other painful occurrences.\nDisturbing events from the past can be the most damaging to how we see ourselves because they hit us in two ways. First is the painful event itself, and second is how you see yourself as a result of that painful event. In EMDR\ntherapy\n, we call these “negative cognitions.” Beliefs about oneself as a result of the trauma or disturbance include messages like “I am bad,” “I am not good enough,” “I am weak,” or “I don’t matter,” to name a few.\nFor example, if you were sexually abused at a young age, you likely remember the event as painful and disturbing. Trying to recall those episodes may be upsetting, and understandably so. More than these emotions, however, the abuse shaped the way you see yourself. Consciously or not, you’ve taken on beliefs, like “I’m never going to be the same” or “Something’s wrong with me.”\nThese fictional, negative stories can and will influence your behavior and decisions. That’s the way the brain works: Beliefs impact feelings, and feelings impact behavior. Choices like who you date, who you marry, and even what career path you follow are all influenced by these self-limiting belief systems. Additionally, they can actively sabotage you, sometimes leading to avoidance behaviors, isolation, and addiction.\nSo, step two means understanding the source of the negative mindset—a process that can take years. However, you don’t need to wait to start step three and begin your healing journey.\nStep 3: Recognize That the Storyteller Is a Liar\nThe third step is to recognize that the negative narrator is a\nliar\n—it wants to convince you of the false\nfantasies\nabout your\nself-worth\n. When you’ve faced your past and done the therapeutic work of acceptance and healing, this step becomes more feasible, because you start\nseeing\ndifferently. You begin to\nsee\nthat these negative belief systems are not true, and as a result you start seeing yourself more positively. This is how the brain produces change in your life, by processing the way you see yourself, your circumstances, your trauma, and even God through a different, more positive lens. Even if you haven’t unpacked your past with a therapist yet, you can still start healing by spending time in reflection, journaling, ",
    "summary": "ever catch yourself thinking “i’m not enough” or “no one will like me”? these self-limiting beliefs are just stories your mind tells you—and neuroscience shows our brains are wired to create these negative narratives, often rooted in past experiences or trauma. 🧠\n\nstep one: notice these thoughts for what they are—just stories, not facts. step two: get curious about where these stories come from. are they echoes of old wounds or voices from your past? the more you recognize this inner critic, the less power it has. step three: remind yourself the negative narrator is a liar. with awareness and self-compassion, you can start to rewrite your story and see yourself in a new, positive light.\n\nrecent neuroscience research highlights how changing our self-talk can actually rewire our brains, improving mood and behavior. so, pause, reflect, and remember—you are more than your inner critic says. healing starts with awareness and a willingness to see yourself differently. 🌱\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #selfworth #healingjourney #selflove"

Johansen Ph.D.\nA New GPS for Intimate Relationships\nGrief\nEvery Relationship Ends in a Test of Self-Care\nOur brains on grief and loss.\nUpdated\nApril 27, 2025\n|\nReviewed by Tyler Woods\nShare\nTweet\nShare on Bluesky\nShare\nEmail\nTHE BASICS\nUnderstanding Grief\nTake our Depression Test\nFind a therapist to heal from grief\nKey points\nAre there more effective, meaningful ways to grieve the loved ones we've lost?\nWhat might ideal grieving look like?\nEmbracing impermanence, permanently.\nEvery relationship ends. Our closest ones end giving painful birth to the insufferable tribulations of\ngrief\nand loss. Merely anticipating loss can evoke emotional pain, but its brute reality can profoundly upend our world—especially when the loss is someone very close to us.\nDoes life dole out a more formidable hurdle? And, in the wake of loss, is our self-care put to any greater test? Ideally, the heart-wrenching assault of loss would seem to necessitate a proportional increase in our self-care. Certainly, how well we tap the support and care of others is a high-ranking test of our personal care, a self-care must. But is there more we can do for ourselves?\nLosing someone would seem to require a\nrelationship-based\n“antidote\" since it is a matter of\nrelationship\nloss. In its traditional forms, this antidote finds expression in our social conventions, the familiar, formal rituals of funerals, wakes, and celebrations of life, where we are expected to say our final goodbyes.\nWithin these familiar congregations, we share our experiences of loss, finding comfort and reassurance among those experiencing the same loss. Of its many advantages, shared grief devests us of the onerous burden of bearing the full weight of our loss alone, which is often the heavier portion of the grief load.\nThe Grieving Brain\nLosing someone, particularly someone close, jolts our brain, causing it to undergo structural change as part of the grief process. Recent\nneuroscience\nfinds that the stronger the\nattachment\nbond and the longer it has been in place—like those between parents and their children or partners in long-term relationships—the more significant these brain changes are.\nWhen first bonding with a soon-to-be significant other, the powerful and illustrious\nhormones\n—\noxytocin\n, vasopressin, and\ndopamine\n—begin to work their neuroendocrinological wonders by forming potentially life-long, virtually indestructible neural bonds. Consider the unbreakable attachment bond between a mother and her child or the enduring bond forged by spouses in a healthy\nmarriage\n.\nBut when these bonds are inevitably broken, the flow of these crucial hormones ebbs, resulting in withdrawal symptoms similar to those of\naddiction\nor\ndepression\n. These symptoms can wreak havoc--cognitively and emotionally--causing a range of impairments in\nconcentration\nand\nshort-term memory\n, disruptions in sleep quality,\nappetite\nand gastrointestinal disturbance, loss of\nmotivation\n, dysphoria, and related physical anomalies, etc. All this begs the obvious question: What are the most effective ways to reduce or alleviate these grief-related ills?\nBetter Grieving\nMedical and psychological models of grieving have historically maintained that grievers go through a period of individually defined mourning or stages of grief, presumably en route to an end point of acceptance or resolution, commonly referred to as closure or letting go. But should closure or letting go be the “gold standard\" of grief resolution, as though a final curtain were being lowered once and forever? Should any love relationship end, especially those that have been profoundly influential? Arguably not.\nTHE BASICS\nUnderstanding Grief\nTake our Depression Test\nFind a therapist to heal from grief\nMaybe our traditional rituals of mourning can be updated, improved or even exchanged for newer forms of self-care that are more complete and effective. Perhaps the length and intensity of our grieving can be lessened, thus speeding the conversion of our mourning into the bittersweet but beneficial emotional nourishment contained in our brain’s vast storage bin of past relationship experience.\nA Bevy of Friendly Ghosts\nI openly invite the “hauntings\" of some very famous “ghosts\" of the past, some of whom have been dead for centuries, even millennia. From their bygone brains to ours, their\nwisdom\n, art, and music resonate in me with an unfailing potency that invigorates and enriches me.\nIn particular, Socrates' counsel to “Question everything\" inspires me to practice intellectual humility, objectivity, and open-mindedness. Similarly, the masterful paintings of Picaso, Dahli, and Chagall, among others, hang in an indelible, easily summoned gallery of my mind’s eye, and like the captivating Baroque music of Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel, they never fail to arouse the stirring, meaningful emotions of my\nright brain\n.\nGrief Essential Reads\nFlipping the Script",
    "summary": "every relationship, no matter how deep, eventually faces the test of grief and self-care. neuroscience shows that losing someone close literally changes our brains—the stronger the bond, the deeper the impact. our brains, shaped by powerful hormones during attachment, experience real withdrawal when those bonds break, leading to symptoms much like addiction or depression. while traditional rituals like funerals help us share the burden, modern science suggests we might need new, more personalized forms of self-care to truly heal. instead of aiming for “closure,” embracing the ongoing influence of our lost loved ones—through memories, art, music, or wisdom—can transform grief into lasting emotional nourishment. this fresh approach not only honors our connections but also supports our mental health, offering a neuroscience-backed path to resilience and growth. 🤍🧠\n\n#grief #selfcare #neuroscience #mentalhealth #healing"

The interpretation being: a problem to solve with more sleep, better\nnutrition\n, or a new supplement. But what if persistent fatigue is not just a mechanical malfunction, but an intelligent signal from the body and mind? Emerging research suggests that chronic fatigue, in all its forms and guises, often reflects deeper misalignments in how we live, think, and respond to our body and environments. Rather than seeing exhaustion as a flailing or faulty battery, we might begin to view it as a message, one that invites curiosity, not just correction.\nFatigue as Communication, Not Just Depletion\nOur bodies are built to continually work towards equilibrium through complex feedback systems. When those systems are taxed—by physical demands, environmental strain, emotional suppression, chronic\nstress\n, or existential misalignment—fatigue often surfaces as an early warning signal. The concept of allostatic load (McEwen and Stellar, 1993) describes how cumulative stress responses wear down the body's adaptive capacity. Meanwhile, neuroscience shows that persistent activation of the stress response system, particularly the sympathetic\nnervous system\n, can exhaust both physical and psychological resources (Porges, 2007).\nRecognising fatigue as feedback, rather than failure, allows for a more compassionate and effective approach. Instead of simply pushing through or assuming we need rest, we can begin decoding the type of fatigue we are experiencing and adjusting accordingly.\nThe Six Distinct Forms of Fatigue\nWe often talk about being ‘tired’ as if it’s one thing. But fatigue comes in many forms, each offering distinct information about what’s going on beneath the surface. Here are six common presentations:\n1. Physical Fatigue\nPhysical fatigue arises naturally after exertion, signalling the need for recovery. For many, this type of tiredness is familiar and even welcome. But clients I work with who live with conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome or\nfibromyalgia\noften describe something altogether different: a fatigue that feels dense, leaden, and unrelieved by rest. Persistent fatigue that doesn’t shift with rest may be pointing to a more systemic imbalance, not just a need for sleep. One client put it succinctly:\n“I can wake up in the morning and feel like I've run a marathon in my sleep.”\n2. Mental Fatigue\nThis is the foggy, drained state that follows intense cognitive effort. It often appears in people navigating a high volume of\ndecision-making\n, multitasking, or prolonged\nscreen time\n. One client, a teacher, described it as\n“my brain stalls mid-sentence, I just can’t think.”\nMental fatigue can also hint at deeper misalignment when the mind is engaged in tasks that don’t connect with personal meaning or values (Boksem and Tops, 2008).\n3. Wired and Tired\nThis paradoxical state combines exhaustion with hyperarousal. It’s a body that won’t stop, even when rest is desperately needed. People often describe being\n“tired but unable to sleep,”\nor\n“exhausted and jittery at the same time.”\nThis often stems from prolonged activation of the stress response system (Porges, 2007), and doesn’t resolve with typical rest strategies. One client likened it to\n“running on fumes with the engine still revving.”\n4. Groggy\nBoredom\nFatigue\nThis type of fatigue often presents as heaviness and apathy, particularly in environments that feel unstimulating or emotionally disengaged. It’s common in people stuck in repetitive routines or unfulfilling relationships. Most of us are familiar with the idea that yawning in company often elicits the joking retort,\n“Sorry, am I boring you?”\nStephen Vodanovich, at the University of West Florida (2003), suggests boredom itself can generate a kind of mental and physical fatigue, particularly when there’s an absence of emotional engagement or meaningful stimulation.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Burnout?\nTake our Burnout Test\nFind a therapist near me\n5. Shutdown\nSometimes fatigue reflects a nervous system collapse rather than exertion. This freeze response can follow prolonged overwhelm or\ntrauma\n, and is marked by a deep sense of exhaustion regardless of activity levels, apathy, numbness, disconnection, and in some ",
    "summary": "feeling tired all the time? 😴 it’s not always about needing more sleep. current neuroscience shows that chronic fatigue is often your body and mind’s way of communicating deeper misalignments—whether physical, mental, emotional, or even existential. instead of pushing through or just resting, try to decode what kind of tiredness you’re experiencing. fatigue can show up as physical exhaustion, mental fog, wired-but-tired stress, boredom-induced grogginess, or even shutdown from overwhelm. each type signals a unique need, not just a lack of energy. by tuning in and understanding these signals, we can respond with more compassion and alignment—not just more hustle. your tiredness might be telling you it’s time for change, not just a nap.\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #fatigue #selfcare #burnout #mindbody"

There it was, written in a book. I took a breath and moved on. I know what this is. No\nshame\nspirals today.\nDepression\nThinking\nMost people are aware that depression can incite\nnegative thinking\n. We become more pessimistic and self-critical when we are depressed. Yet, something less known is that depression can also affect your ability to think clearly.\nIf you feel like you are thinking more slowly and struggling to get things done while depressed, you are probably right. A systemic review found that individuals experiencing major depression consistently showed slower processing speed. They also had difficulties with\nexecutive functioning\nor engaging in the tasks necessary to plan or complete another task (Nuño and colleagues, 2021).\nOther research has identified depression-related difficulties in cognitive domains as diverse as\nattention\nand\nlong-term memory\n(Hammar and colleagues, 2022).\nYet, positively, many of these deficits appear to improve when a person reaches recovery from their depression (Kriesche and colleagues, 2023).\nIt's Not in Your Head, It's in Your Brain\nWhy does this happen? My undergraduate professors taught me that much of this relates to\nmotivation\n. When we feel down, it is difficult to wrangle the energy to best engage our brain resources. Although such demoralization may play a role, more current research suggests there may be neurological reasons as well.\nResearch investigating how and why depression affects our ability to remember things and concentrate has suggested neuroinflammation as a possible mechanism. Specifically, neuroinflammation affecting the hippocampus, a brain region believed to be key in memory, appears to disrupt an important process. The hippocampus is one section of the brain capable of a fantastic process called neurogenesis, which creates new neurons and connections. Neuroinflammation linked to depression seems to inhibit this process (Wu and Zhang, 2023).\nWhat Can You Do?\nIf you are struggling with cognitive symptoms of depression, you are not alone. Here are a few simple steps to tackle these frustrating challenges.\nSelf-Compassion\nDifficulties with memory, attention, and processing speed set us up for self-criticism. Remember that these symptoms are part of depression. They aren't your fault. Give yourself the kindness you would give a friend. If you make a mistake, show grace. If you notice your mind spouting off unkind\nself-talk\n, respond to yourself with compassion.\n2.\nAdaptive Strategies\nDuring times of depression, utilizing all available tools can be helpful. Simple strategies like writing things down, setting phone alarms to remind you about important tasks, and giving yourself more breaks with high-demand cognitive tasks are ways you can work around depression's effects.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Depression?\nTake our Depression Test\nFind a therapist to overcome depression\n3.\nAsk for Help\nCognitive symptoms can be like an alarm signaling a need for help. Receiving support for your depression is vital. Many depression treatments, including\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation\n(Luber and colleagues, 2014) and some medications (McIntyre and colleagues, 2014), have been demonstrated to address this class of symptoms.\nReferences\nHammar, Å., Ronold, E.

    "summary": "feeling foggy or forgetful during depression? it's not just in your head—it's in your brain 🧠. new neuroscience research shows that depression can trigger neuroinflammation, especially in the hippocampus, disrupting memory and clear thinking. this means slower processing, trouble focusing, and difficulties with planning. the good news: these cognitive symptoms often improve with recovery and treatment. self-compassion, practical strategies (like notes and reminders), and seeking support can make a real difference. remember, struggling to think clearly is a symptom—not a personal failure. give yourself grace as you heal. #depression #mentalhealth #neuroscience #brainhealth #selfcompassion"

    "text": "Building 'cellular bridges' for spinal cord repair after injury | ScienceDaily\nScience News\nfrom research organizations\nBuilding 'cellular bridges' for spinal cord repair after injury\nIn mice, programmed cells help regenerate axons, restore leg function\nDate:\nApril 21, 2025\nSource:\nOhio State University\nSummary:\nCapitalizing on the flexibility of tiny cells inside the body's smallest blood vessels may be a powerful spinal cord repair strategy, new research suggests.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nCapitalizing on the flexibility of tiny cells inside the body's smallest blood vessels may be a powerful spinal cord repair strategy, new research suggests.\nIn mouse experiments, scientists introduced a specific type of recombinant protein to the site of a spinal cord injury where these cells, called pericytes, had flooded the lesion zone. Once exposed to this protein, results showed, pericytes change shape and inhibit the production of some molecules while secreting others, creating \"cellular bridges\" that support regeneration of axons -- the long, slender extensions of nerve cell bodies that transmit messages.\nResearchers observed axon regrowth in injured mice that received a single treatment injection of the growth-factor protein, and the animals also regained movement in their hind limbs. An experiment involving human cells suggests the results are not restricted to mice.\n\"There's a lot more that can be learned and a lot that can be expanded, but the more we worked on this, the more stunned we really were by the potency of this single treatment and how effective it was,\" said senior study author Andrea Tedeschi, associate professor of neuroscience in The Ohio State University College of Medicine. \"This finding goes beyond spinal cord injury -- it has implications in brain injury and stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases as well.\"\nThe work underscores how important blood vessel restoration is to recovery of neurological function after a spinal cord injury, researchers said.\n\"Spinal cord injuries are severe not only because they prevent transmission of information across the site of the injury, but because all of the vasculature structure and function is also compromised,\" said first study author Wenjing Sun, assistant professor of neuroscience at Ohio State. \"Even if you are able to reestablish neuronal connectivity from one end to the other, the overall effect will still not be maximized unless you take care of everything else that falls apart.\"\nThe study was published April 18 in the journal\nMolecular Therapy\n.\nPrevious research suggesting pericytes interfere with spinal cord injury recovery had led some scientists to recommend clearing them from the lesion site to aid repair. But cancer research has indicated pericytes' properties change when they're exposed to a protein called platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) -- which is one way tumors generate their own blood supply. In cancer, the aim is to block PDGF-BB signaling.\nEarlier neuroscience research also indicated that pericytes are highly \"plastic,\" meaning they are very responsive to changes in the microenvironment -- including the presence of PDGF-BB. Tedeschi and colleagues saw potential to harness that cell-protein relationship to stabilize the vasculature surrounding a spinal cord injury. In the process, they found the newly sprouted blood vessels established a pathway for regenerated axons to follow.\nStarting with imaging studies, the team showed that when a spinal cord is severed, pericytes migrate into the injury site over time but don't promote growth of functional blood vessels that are needed to support axon regeneration.\nIn cell-culture experiments, the researchers established a \"carpet\" of pericytes, added PDGF-BB, and then placed a layer of adult mouse sensory neurons on top and evaluated how much axons grew in 24 hours. The treated axons grew nearly as much as healthy axons extend under normal conditions.\nPDGF-BB alone did not produce this result. Instead, experiments showed that pericytes combined with the growth factor rearranged fibronectin, a multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein that plays a critical role in tissue repair, cell attachment and motility. The cells themselves also change shape, becoming more elongated.\n\"We know these cells are going to infiltrate and deposit at the lesion epicenter. These elongated fiber structures that they become are far more permissive in promoting axons to regenerate from one end to the other and bypass the injury,\" Tedeschi said.\n\"To extend the clinical relevance of our findings, we cultured mouse neurons on top of human pericytes that were exposed to PDGF-BB, and that was sufficient to trigger a growth-promoting effect, suggesting that this might really be a generalized phenomenon that is not restricted to mice.\"\nTurning to experiments in animals with spinal cord injury, researchers waited for seven days after the injury -- the equivalent of about nine months in a",
    "summary": "exciting new research has found that harnessing the flexibility of pericytes—tiny cells from our blood vessels—could be key to repairing spinal cord injuries 🧬. by introducing a specific growth-factor protein, scientists guided these cells to form “cellular bridges” at the injury site, helping nerve fibers (axons) regrow and restore movement in mice 🐭. even more promising, similar effects were seen with human cells in lab tests, hinting at future therapies for people. this discovery is especially relevant for neuroscience, as it highlights the critical role of blood vessel repair in healing the nervous system, not just after spinal cord injuries, but potentially for brain injuries, strokes, and neurodegenerative diseases too. while more research is needed, this breakthrough could pave the way for innovative treatments that help the body heal itself from within. #neuroscience #spinalcordinjury #regeneration #scienceupdate"

It signals unmet needs, unprocessed fears, or a lack of clarity. Why do we hesitate, avoid, or resist what’s ahead? With science-backed insights, you can break through resistance—and use it to fuel your growth.\nSource: marrio31 / Getty Images Signature\nMy Journey\nThroughout my\ncareer\nas a surgeon, educator, and leader, I witnessed firsthand how good\nleadership\ncan inspire—and how poor leadership can create toxic, disorganized, and high-\nstress\nenvironments, affecting morale,\nproductivity\n, and patient care.\nUnfortunately, poor leadership seemed far too common. I repeatedly saw the fallout—particularly from the lack of accountability—contributing to rising mental health concerns among healthcare professionals, trainees, and administrators. Recognizing a gap in leadership training in medical\neducation\n, I felt compelled to act, sparking my transition to developing and teaching\nneuroscience\n-informed leadership programs rooted in self-awareness.\nLeaving full-time surgery wasn’t easy. I grappled with the same resistance many face during major life changes: Would others understand? Would I be judged for stepping away from an established, respected career?\nFear\nof criticism—especially from my peers—weighed heavily. But, as I gained clarity in my mission, I realized I had a responsibility to move forward, to share the expertise and insights I had earned, regardless of whether others fully understood. I chose to align my actions with my purpose and the positive impact I wished to make, not with their judgments.\nThis journey taught me the crucial importance of psychological safety—creating a space where we feel safe to make mistakes, ask questions, and embrace change. It’s the foundation for overcoming resistance, and it’s a vital skill I now teach to leaders in healthcare, education, and beyond.\nHere are the steps I took—and that you can take—to navigate resistance and lead change with\nconfidence\n, for yourself and your teams.\nStep 1: Understand Resistance as a Biological Response\nThe first step in overcoming resistance is recognizing that it’s not about being “weak” or “scared”—it’s simply your brain doing its job to keep you safe. Our brains are wired for survival, and when we face something new or uncertain, the amygdala—the part of the brain responsible for detecting threats—is activated. This triggers the\nfight-or-flight\nresponse, an automatic reaction where the body prepares either to confront the perceived threat (\nfight\n) or escape from it (\nflight\n). As a result, we may feel\nanxious\n, defensive, or even paralyzed when confronted with change.\nRecognizing that this reaction is completely normal—and rooted in biology—is key to removing self-judgment. When we understand that resistance is simply our brain’s way of protecting us, we can stop beating ourselves up for feeling unsettled and instead focus on adapting to the new situation. Once we accept this biological response for what it is, we can begin to reframe how we approach change—with greater self-compassion and strategic clarity.\nStep 2: Create Psychological Safety\nThe second step is to create psychological safety. This means building an environment where change isn’t something to fear, but something people feel safe enough to embrace. When we feel secure enough to make mistakes, ask questions, and share ideas without fear of\nembarrassment\nor judgment, our brains shift out of survival mode and into growth mode. Fear quiets down, and we can focus our energy on moving forward.\nPsychological safety is essential for real growth and positive change. Without it, our brains stay stuck in defense mode, making it harder to think clearly, learn new things, or work well with others. When psychological safety is present,\nmotivation\nimproves, problem-solving becomes easier, and change feels much less overwhelming.\nImportantly, creating psychological safety doesn’t mean avoiding mistakes—it means making it safe to stumble, reflect, and improve. It’s about creating a culture where being open and honest is welcomed and where failure is seen as part of the path to getting better.\nWhen psychological safety is present, resistance to change naturally softens. People become more willing to step into the unknown because they trust\nthe environment\naround them.\nStep 3: Lead by Example\nTo build psychologica",
    "summary": "resistance to change is a natural, biological response—your brain’s way of keeping you safe. but what if you could turn that pushback into your greatest asset? neuroscience shows that understanding resistance, rather than fighting it, helps us grow. by creating psychological safety—spaces where mistakes are embraced and questions are welcomed—we move from survival mode to growth mode. leadership isn’t just about direction, it’s about building trust and modeling courage through change. when we lead by example and foster open communication, resistance transforms from a barrier into motivation for progress. these steps are vital for anyone navigating change, especially in healthcare, education, and leadership roles today. embrace resistance, learn from it, and let it guide you toward positive transformation. 💡✨\n\n#neuroscience #leadership #growthmindset #psychologicalsafety #changemakers"

Ruffalo.\nThe \"relational\" approach—whether in its original form in relational\npsychoanalysis\nor in the later \"relational turns\" across other psychotherapies—rests on a core premise: that our minds and mental lives are not confined within the bounds of our skulls, as traditional psychological and\npsychiatric\nmodels have long assumed. The prevailing view, that mental life is internal, individual, and self-contained—what we might call the \"atomistic\" conception of mind—has given way to an understanding of mind as fundamentally shaped by and embedded within interpersonal dynamics and intersubjective experience.\nThis represents a \"paradigm shift\" from what is often termed a \"one-person\" to a \"two-person\" psychology. The one-person model, rooted in Cartesian dualism and its modern heirs, imagines the mind as a private, enclosed system, separated from others and the world outside. This\nphilosophy\nserved as the foundation of\nFreud\n's original psychological model, and it continues to underpin mainstream psychiatric and clinical psychological models. The two-person model emerged from a confluence of object relations theories (e.g., Fairbairn, Winnicott, Balint),\nattachment\nresearch, and existential-phenomenological thought. It decisively rejects the Cartesian mythology of the isolated individual, arguing that the mind is—we are—fundamentally open to and interwoven with the fabric of human relationships and social experience.\nWhile \"two-person psychology\" and the \"relational model\" are relatively modern terms, their roots can be traced back to the work of Freud's colleague-turned-heretic, Sándor Ferenczi, who was among the first to place relational dynamics at the heart of psychic life. Since the very beginning, it has had an uneasy relationship with the psychiatric status quo, which has been thoroughly invested in the diagnosis of \"individual mental disorders\" owing to its medical foundation.\nSource: Placidplace/Pixabay\nI argue that not only is the one-person, Cartesian model philosophically obsolete—a view widely accepted in the social sciences outside psychiatry and psychology—but also that it has been empirically discredited. We now know that infants do not come into this world as private, self-involved beings, as Descartes, then Freud, and later others such as Piaget had assumed and built their models around. Infant research over the past 50 years has conclusively shown that we are interpersonally open, sensitive, and attuned to primary others and the immediate environment from birth.\nNeuroscience\ncorroborates this: The limbic system and prefrontal cortex, critical to our emotional and psychological lives, emerge through attachment experiences with caregivers over time and are dependent for their functioning on proper interpersonal relations thereafter. The science shows, in other words, that we are not solitary minds that merely relate; we are fundamentally relational beings.\nThis causes a fundamental problem for models of individual \"mental disorder\" and the diagnoses which follow from them. Such diagnoses are constrained, by definition, to experiences\nwithin\nindividuals—to internal mental or physiological states, or to behaviors taken to result from such states. The\nDSM\n, for instance, describes mental disorders as \"dysfunctions in the individual.\" This is not a scientific conclusion but a presupposition imported from the outside. From a two-person standpoint, this is fundamentally in error, as the experiences in question extend beyond the individual and incorporate others and aspects of the personal world. There are only persons-in-relations—interpersonal, familial, societal relations—so the \"disorder,\" if we still call it that, must include these within it. This is vital.\nThe shift to a two-person psychology involves a shift from a \"biopsychosocial\" model to what we might call a \"sociopsychobio\" model. Rather than beginning with individual functioning and extending outward, the sociopsychobio model starts with relational and social experience and understands psychological and biological functioning within that context. What is dysfunctional, then, or what is to be \"diagnosed,\" is not primarily the failure of ",
    "summary": "the traditional view of mental disorders as isolated, internal problems is being challenged by a growing wave of relational psychology and neuroscience. instead of seeing the mind as a closed, self-contained system, new research shows our mental lives are deeply shaped by relationships and social context. neuroscience backs this up—key brain regions tied to emotion and self-regulation develop through interactions with caregivers and others. this shift from a “one-person” to a “two-person” model suggests that mental health diagnoses should focus less on individual pathology and more on our connections with others. as neuroscience continues to highlight the importance of social bonds, it’s clear: we are not just solitary minds, but fundamentally relational beings. 🧠🤝\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #relationalpsychology #psychotherapy #brainhealth"

Recently, there’s been a growing trend to cut family out of one’s life when conflicts arise or emotional pain becomes too much to bear. This choice, known as \"family cutoff,\" is often applauded as an act of self-preservation. While it might seem like a solution, research and Bowen Family Systems Theory suggest that cutoff can carry lasting emotional and relational consequences for individuals and future generations.\nThe Cycle of Cutoff\nAs a family therapist, I often witness how cutoff cycles through family lines. When one member severs ties, it sets a pattern where others see avoidance of conflict as the only option. Over time, these repeated cutoffs create families that rely on disengagement rather than healthy communication or resolution. What may start as a self-protective choice can end up damaging broader family relationships.\nBowen Family Systems Theory sheds light on this behavior, defining cutoff as a way individuals distance themselves from family members to manage\nstress\nor emotional pain. This might mean physical separation, lack of communication, or total estrangement. While cutoff can occur in any dynamic—between parents and children, siblings, or extended family members—it’s often an emotional reaction to unresolved relational tension.\nThe problem with cutoff is that while it aims to reduce discomfort in the short term, it rarely addresses the deeper issues at hand. These unresolved emotional ties remain beneath the surface, potentially leading to further cutoffs or perpetuating unhealthy patterns across generations. Left unchecked, cutoff can create an environment where meaningful relationships diminish.\nResearch on Family Estrangement\nFamily estrangement is not as rare as some might assume. A 2020 survey by the organization Stand Alone found that over 25 percent of adults in the U.S. had experienced family estrangement at some point, with about 12 percent actively estranged from at least one family member. Parental estrangement, particularly between adult children and their parents, is among the most common forms.\nWhile the immediate aftermath of cutoff may bring relief for some, its long-term consequences often come at a high cost to emotional and physical well-being. Research highlights several important findings on the effects of estrangement:\nThe Impact of Loneliness:\nStudies, such as one conducted by Stokes et al. (2021), show that\nsocial isolation\nsignificantly increases all-cause mortality risk, often equating the effects of loneliness to other major health risks like\nsmoking\nor obesity.\nEstrangement's Emotional Toll:\nBoth estrangers and those estranged often report feelings of\ngrief\n,\nshame\n, and unresolved\nanger\n. Estrangement can lead to symptoms of\nanxiety\nand\ndepression\n, though more research is needed to further quantify its emotional toll.\nGenerational Effects:\nFamily estrangements often disrupt the flow of connection and shared history, fragmenting the sense of\nidentity\nfor younger generations. Bowen’s theory underscores how patterns of disengagement ripple across families, reshaping the dynamics of connection for decades.\nDespite these outcomes, it is essential to acknowledge that cutoff isn’t inherently “good” or “bad.” For some, estrangement provides crucial distance from abusive or deeply harmful relationships. However, as a widespread coping strategy, the practice raises important questions about emotional health and family legacy.\nTHE BASICS\nFamily Dynamics\nFind a Family Therapy Therapist\nUnderstanding Cutoff Through the Systems Lens\nBowen Family Systems Theory views relationships as interconnected and reciprocal, meaning tension in one area affects the entire family system. From this perspective, cutoff is often a response to unresolved emotional conflict and an attempt to create instant relief by removing the source of discomfort. However, this approach rarely addresses the root cause of tensions.\nInstead, cutoff typically offers an illusion of calm while leaving emotional patterns like\nguilt\n, resentment, and\nattachment\nneeds unresolved. These unresolved issues often resurface with romantic partners, friends, or colleagues, perpetuating conflict in other areas of life.\nHuman beings are biologically and psychologically wired for connection. Re",
    "summary": "family cutoff—choosing to end contact with relatives—has become more common, but neuroscience and family systems theory reveal it’s not a simple fix. while cutting ties can feel like self-protection, research shows it often leads to loneliness, anxiety, and disrupts generational bonds. our brains are wired for connection, and estrangement can deeply impact emotional health, sometimes as much as other major health risks. instead of total cutoff, setting boundaries or seeking therapy can help address conflict while preserving the potential for healing. understanding the roots of family tension can break cycles and support healthier relationships for the future.\n\n#neuroscience #familydynamics #mentalhealth #boundaries #healing"

These are not the narratives we deliberately recall, but rather the implicit memories etched into our cells—memories that can suddenly resurface in response to a familiar\nscent\n, sound, or sensation, triggering reactions that seem to bypass rational thought entirely.\nThe Biology of Trauma Memory\nWhen we experience trauma, our bodies encode the experience through multiple pathways beyond the conscious mind. Research increasingly shows that\ntraumatic\nexperiences create what psychologists call \"implicit\nmemory\n\"—\nunconscious\nrecollections that influence our behavior without our awareness.\nThese memories don't simply reside in the brain. They permeate our entire physical being through several mechanisms.\nThe Amygdala: Emotional Memory Center\nThe amygdala plays a crucial role in processing emotional memories, particularly those associated with\nfear\n. Unlike the hippocampus, which matures more slowly, the amygdala develops earlier and creates powerful emotional memories that can persist even when explicit recall is impossible. This is one reason why trauma experienced in early\nchildhood\n—even before the development of language or conscious recall—can still profoundly affect adult behavior and emotional responses.\nThe Body's Chemical Scripts\nTrauma also writes its story through\nneurochemical changes\n. When we experience extreme\nstress\n, our bodies release stress\nhormones\nlike cortisol and adrenaline, which help encode emotional memories more strongly. This process, designed evolutionarily to help us remember dangerous situations, can become problematic when the system is overwhelmed by trauma.\nTrauma can also affect\ngene\nexpression through\nepigenetic modifications\n, potentially passing these altered stress responses to subsequent generations. This suggests that cellular memory extends beyond the individual to potentially influence family systems.\nThe field of\npsychoneuroimmunology\nexplores how trauma affects immune function, with studies showing that traumatic experiences can trigger long-term inflammatory responses that persist long after the danger has passed.\nGroundbreaking work with\norgan transplant recipients\nsuggests cellular memory may extend throughout our bodies. This research has found multiple cases where\nheart transplant recipients\nreported new preferences,\ndreams\n, or emotional responses that mirrored those of their donors—suggesting that aspects of memory and\npersonality\nmight be encoded within the cells of organs beyond the brain.\nWhen the Past Becomes Present: Trauma Triggers\nFor those who have experienced trauma, seemingly innocuous stimuli can suddenly activate these cellular memories, creating \"flashbacks\" or \"emotional flooding.\" These responses often seem disproportionate to the current situation precisely because they're not actually responses to the present—they're reactions to implicit memories of past danger.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Trauma?\nTake our Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Test\nFind a therapist to heal from trauma.\nDr. Bessel van der Kolk describes this phenomenon as \"the body keeping the score\"—the tendency for traumatic memories to be stored somatically and triggered physiologically. When triggered, the body reacts as if the danger is present, initiating a cascade of neurobiological responses:\nThe amygdala signals threat.\nStress hormones flood the system.\nThe rational prefrontal cortex becomes less active.\nThe body prepares for fight, flight, or freeze.\nWhat makes these reactions particularly challenging is their non-verbal nature. Rather than emerging as a coherent narrative, they manifest as physical sensations, emotions, or behavioral impulses that seem to come from nowhere. A person might experience racing heart, muscle tension, or overwhelming emotional states without understanding why.\nTrauma Essential Reads\nThe Terror of Being Hunted by a Buzzing Drone\nUnderstanding Trauma Beyond Emotional Pain\nTransforming Cellular Memory: Pathways to Healing\nUnderstanding trauma as cellular implicit memory opens new avenues for healing. Traditional talk therapy, while valuable for many aspects of recovery, may not fully address memories stored outside language-based systems. Instead, approaches that engage the body and work with physiological responses show part",
    "summary": "did you know our bodies can store memories of trauma, even if our minds can't recall them? research in neuroscience is revealing that traumatic experiences are encoded not just in the brain, but throughout our entire body—affecting our behavior, emotions, and even our genes. the amygdala, our emotional memory center, can lock in fear and stress responses before we even learn to speak. these \"cellular memories\" can be triggered by sights, sounds, or sensations, causing reactions that seem to come out of nowhere. this understanding is changing how we approach healing—moving beyond talk therapy to include body-based techniques that help release trauma stored deep within us. as science uncovers more about how trauma lives in our cells, new hope emerges for healing both mind and body. 🧠💫\n\n#trauma #neuroscience #healing #mentalhealth #bodymindconnection"

And research shows that we have an inherent “negativity\nbias\n” to focus on our problems, which can further drag us down (Rozin & Royzman, 2001). Yet research has also found that focusing on positive events can counteract downward spirals of negativity and increase our well-being (Garland et al., 2010; Hurley & Kwon, 2013).\nOne powerful way to increase our positivity is to actively build hope. Pioneering research in Hope Theory by psychologist C.R. Snyder, PhD (1994), has shown that hope involves three qualities: 1) Goals 2) Pathways 3) Agency.\nClinical psychologist David Feldman, Ph.D., and I conducted a study that showed how putting goals, pathways, and agency into active steps can significantly increase people’s hope (Feldman & Dreher, 2012).\nHere’s how you can use these three steps to build your own hope.\n1. Goals\nChoose a goal you’d like to achieve in the next six months. Make it an\napproach goal\nlike “I want to be fit and healthy,” “I want to enjoy life,” or “I want to have more friends.” Approach goals (striving for what you want) promote personal well-being while avoidance goals (striving to avoid negative situations) are associated with\nanxiety\nand distress (Emmons, 2003).\nChoose your own approach goal, like improving your physical fitness, beginning a new hobby, making new friends, or something else you’d like to achieve. Focusing on this positive goal can not only help you progress in that one area, it can also evoke positive emotions to “broaden and build” your capacity for\nhappiness\n, well-being, and success (Fredrickson, 2003).\n2. Pathways\nDave Feldman and I asked each of our experiment participants to write down their goal, then write down three steps they could take toward their goal. You can do the same.\nFor a fitness goal, you could sign up for an exercise class or begin a walking, jogging, or running practice. Research has shown that regular exercise can improve emotional well-being and even help relieve\ndepression\n(Penedo & Dahn, 2005; Rethorst & Trivedi 2010). You may want to consult your health care professional before beginning an exercise program, and begin reasonably, walking or running a few blocks at first, then gradually increasing your distance.\nIf your goal is adding more enjoyment to your life, you could begin a new hobby. Your steps might include signing up for a class at the local community center, taking that old guitar out of the closet, going to a music store and signing up for lessons, or something else.\nIf your goal is to have more friends, your steps might include reconnecting with an old friend with a text, card, or phone call. Or you could begin making new friends by following your interest—taking a class, joining a group at your local church, synagogue, or community center, working for a cause you believe in, or something else.\nBut choosing three steps is\nnot\nenough. Life happens. Unexpected events can throw you off course. We asked our participants to write down a possible obstacle for each of their three steps and an alternate action to deal with each obstacle. You can do the same.\nFor example, years ago, I signed up for a Saturday morning yoga class. The obstacle was that it was tempting to sleep in on Saturday mornings. My positive alternate action was\nfriendship\n. Because my friend Janette was also taking the yoga class, I made it to class because I didn’t want to disappoint her. In another example, my friend Peggy committed to a walking practice around her neighborhood. Her obstacle was rain. So on rainy days, she walked inside the local shopping mall.\n3. Agency\nYou’ll need agency, or\nmotivation\n, to keep moving forward. Some ways to build your agency are to:\nUse positive\nself-talk\n—tell yourself, “You can do it!”\nPost a motivational quote by your desk or on your bathroom mirror.\nShare your goal with a friend and encourage each other.\nVisualize yourself reaching your goal.\nTHE BASICS\nWhat Is Motivation?\nTake our Burnout Test\nFind a therapist near me\nDave Feldman and I helped our participants build their agency with\nvisualization\n. In a guided\nmeditation\n, we asked them to close their eyes and visualize themselves taking each step, encountering each roadblock, taking ea",
    "summary": "feeling overwhelmed by negative news? neuroscience shows we’re wired with a “negativity bias,” but there’s hope—literally! research highlights that hope isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a skill you can build. hope theory breaks it down into three parts: setting meaningful goals, mapping out pathways to reach them, and building agency (the motivation to keep going). \n\nchoose an approach goal that excites you, like getting fit, learning something new, or making friends. next, write three concrete steps you can take—and plan for possible obstacles with backup actions. finally, boost your motivation with positive self-talk, visual reminders, or sharing your journey with a friend. \n\nthese simple steps don’t just help you reach your goals—they also increase happiness, resilience, and overall well-being, as proven by recent psychological and neuroscientific studies. in today’s world, intentionally building hope is more relevant than ever for mental health. 🌱✨\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #hope #wellbeing #positivity"

While it was known that cannabis influences dopamine, this study clarifies where in the brain these changes occur. Cannabis use disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their cannabis use, continues despite negative effects, and may experience cravings or withdrawal.\n\"For a long time, clinical researchers across the world have been searching for a link showing that cannabis affects the brain mechanism behind psychosis. We now show that a shared dopamine pathway could be the answer,\" Ahrens said.\nThe study involved 61 people, including those with and without cannabis use disorder, as well as individuals with early-stage schizophrenia, some of whom also had CUD. Using a specialized brain scan called neuromelanin-MRI, researchers at Western University measured their neuromelanin signal, which reflects dopamine activity.\nPeople with CUD had an abnormally high neuromelanin signal, and the elevation was tied to the severity of their cannabis use. In contrast, those without schizophrenia or CUD did not show this increase. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nEducating youth about cannabis risks\nAbout one-in-five youth in Canada are cannabis users, consuming it daily or almost daily. Understanding the drug's impact on mental health remains a pressing question.\n\"The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,\" said Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, Professor of Psychiatry at McGill and Psychiatrist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.\n\"Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use, especially for those with a family history of psychosis,\" he said.\nFuture research will explore whether long-term cannabis use leads to lasting dopamine changes and whether these effects reverse after quitting.\nAbout the study\n\"Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System\" by Jessica Ahrens, Clifford Cassidy, and Lena Palaniyappan et al., was published in\nJama Psychiatry.\nThe study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Schizophrenia Society of Canada Foundation, the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis, the Fonds de Recherche du Québec -- Santé, the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, the Canada Research Chairs program and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nControlled Substances\nMental Health Research\nDiseases and Conditions\nMind & Brain\nMarijuana\nSchizophrenia\nIllegal Drugs\nPlants & Animals\nBiology\nMice\nAnimal Learning and Intelligence\nRELATED TERMS\nDopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia\nDopamine\nNeurosis\nBipolar disorder\nCannabis\nSeasonal affective disorder\nElectroconvulsive therapy\nInterpersonal relationship\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nMcGill University\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nJessica Ahrens, Sabrina D.

Findings from this groundbreaking study in\nBiological Psychiatry\n, published by Elsevier, provide unprecedented insights into the interplay of different brain cell types in Tourette syndrome, suggesting new therapeutic directions.\nWhat makes this study particularly groundbreaking is that it not only confirms previous findings about the loss of interneurons and inflammatory brain changes in Tourette syndrome but also provides new understanding about how different cell types in the brain interact and influence each other in this disorder.\nLead investigator Flora M. Vaccarino, MD, Child Study Center and Department of Neuroscience, Yale University, Yale Stem Cell Center, and Yale Kavli Institute for Neuroscience, explains, \"While previous research using brain imaging has shown that the deep brain nuclei, the caudate-putamen, that are primarily involved in the control of movement programs, are smaller in people with Tourette syndrome, and our prior studies have found a decrease in interneurons in the basal ganglia region, we lacked a comprehensive understanding of exactly how different cell types in these brain regions are affected by the condition.\"\nIn the current investigation the research team analyzed brain tissue samples from six individuals who had severe Tourette syndrome and six matched control subjects without the condition. Using cutting-edge technology that enables the study of individual brain cells, they examined the genes that were expressed in each cell type and the regulatory elements that control gene activity.\nAdvanced single-cell analysis techniques revealed three key changes in the brains of individuals with Tourette syndrome:\nThere were about 50% fewer interneurons (specialized brain cells that help regulate the pace of brain electrical activity) in the caudate-putamen region within the basal ganglia, which is crucial for controlling movement. These interneurons normally help down-regulate neuronal activity, and their loss may explain why individuals with Tourette syndrome experience difficulty controlling movements and vocalizations.\nThe medium spiny neurons, which are the main long-range projection neurons in this brain region, showed signs of metabolic stress, with decreased activity in mitochondrial genes that control cellular energy production.\nThe immune cells of the brain (microglia) showed increased inflammatory activity, and this inflammatory response was directly correlated with the metabolic stress in the medium spiny neurons. This unexpected relationship suggests these cells are communicating in ways that have not been previously recognized in Tourette syndrome.\nTogether, these findings create a pattern that may explain why individuals with Tourette syndrome experience involuntary movements and vocalizations.\nCo-lead author Yifan Wang, PhD, Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, notes, \"We found evidence suggesting that these changes in gene activity may be caused by alterations in the regulatory elements that control gene expression, providing new insights into how Tourette syndrome develops and new directions for future research. These findings suggest that the disease may not be caused by defective genes, but rather by improperly switching them on or off during development and lifetime.\"\nTourette syndrome affects as many as 1 in 150 children. Its primary symptoms are motor and vocal tics, such as eye-blinking or throat clearing that are performed out-of-context and in a repetitive fashion.\nCo-lead author Liana Fasching, PhD, Child Study Center, Yale University, remarks, \"What makes this research particularly compelling is that despite Tourette syndrome having one of the highest familial recurrence rates among complex neuropsychiatric disorders, large genetic studies have identified only a few risk genes. This suggested to us that we needed t",
    "summary": "new research just unveiled the most detailed look yet at the brain changes behind tourette syndrome. by analyzing individual brain cells from people with tourette's, scientists discovered a dramatic loss of interneurons—cells that help control movement—in key brain regions, as well as stressed-out neurons and heightened inflammation. these findings reveal a complex interplay between cell types and suggest that tourette's may arise not from faulty genes, but from how genes are switched on or off over time. this breakthrough opens the door to new, more targeted therapies and deepens our understanding of how brain cell communication shapes behavior. as neuroscience moves toward precision medicine, studies like this bring hope for better treatments for tourette's and other brain disorders. 🧠✨\n\n#tourette #neuroscience #brainresearch #mentalhealth #scienceupdate"

In a mouse study, they describe a brain pathway that starts with neurons (labeled in green, above) that sense inflammation signals, and the researchers were able to treat the loss of motivation by blocking this pathway.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nThe fatigue and lack of motivation that many cancer patients experience near the end of life have been seen as the unavoidable consequences of their declining physical health and extreme weight loss. But new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis challenges that long-held assumption, showing instead that these behavioral changes stem from specific inflammation-sensing neurons in the brain.\nIn a study published April 11 in\nScience\n, the researchers report that they identified a direct connection between cancer-related inflammation and the loss of motivation characteristic of advanced cancer. Studying mice with cancer-linked cachexia, a condition typical of the disease that leads to muscle wasting and weight loss, they discovered a previously unrecognized pathway in the brain. This pathway senses inflammation and actively suppresses dopamine -- a key driver of motivation -- resulting in apathy and loss of drive.\nBlocking the pathway restored motivation, even though the cancer and weight loss continued. This indicates that apathy can be treated separately from the disease itself.\n\"The implications of the research are profound,\" said the study's lead author, Adam Kepecs, PhD, professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry at WashU Medicine. \"We've uncovered a direct brain mechanism through which inflammation drives apathy in cancer, and we were able to restore normal motivation in mice with cachexia, despite ongoing inflammation as cancer progressed.\"\nAbout 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience cachexia. In addition to physical decline, patients often suffer from severe fatigue, apathy and a lack of motivation that affect their overall quality of life.\nTo understand whether these psychological symptoms are side effects that emerge from physical deterioration or whether they arise from distinct biological mechanisms, the research team, including Marco Pignatelli, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Tobias Janowitz, MD, PhD, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, turned to a well-validated mouse model of cancer cachexia. They focused specifically on behavioral symptoms, which had not previously been investigated, and mapped the brain regions involved.\nThey discovered that a structure in the brainstem, a part of the brain that controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate, acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals in the bloodstream, particularly a molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is elevated in cancer cachexia. When IL-6 levels rise, neurons in this region of the brainstem transmit a signal through a defined pathway that suppresses dopamine release in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, which is key for motivation and reward. The resulting drop in dopamine had the effect of making the mice less motivated to exert themselves to complete activities.\nTo see if interfering with this response could treat the lack of motivation and apathy, Kepecs and his colleagues tried two different approaches: they boosted dopamine levels and blocked inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem. Both approaches eliminated or reduced apathy in the mice. Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal's motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer.\n\"What's remarkable is that motivation was restored even in late-stage disease,\" said Pignatelli. \"It suggests we may be able to improve quality of life by targeting the brain circuit.\"\nFor acute illnesses such as infections, this inflammation-driven reduction in motivation may be adaptive, helping the body conserve energy to fight off disease, Kepecs explained. But in chronic conditions such as cachexia, prolonged apathy -- including a reduced drive to eat, move or engage socially -- can become harmful, worsening health and quality of life. Because IL-6 -- the inflammatory molecule driving this effect -- is elevated in many other conditions, and the brain regions involved are central to motivation, this same circuit likely contributes to",
    "summary": "new research has uncovered a direct brain pathway linking inflammation to the loss of motivation and energy seen in advanced cancer. scientists found that specific neurons in the brain sense inflammatory signals from cancer, which then suppress dopamine—the brain’s motivation chemical—leading to apathy and fatigue. by blocking this pathway in mice, researchers were able to restore motivation, even as the disease continued. this breakthrough suggests that the mental and emotional symptoms of cancer, like severe fatigue and lack of drive, aren’t just side effects of physical decline, but can be targeted and treated directly. these findings offer hope for improving quality of life for cancer patients, and may also have implications for other chronic illnesses where inflammation affects the brain. 💡🧠\n\n#neuroscience #cancerresearch #motivation #brainhealth"

Using mouse models, researchers now show that if antibiotics are administered with an enzyme called endolysin, the combined effect protects against infection by resistant bacteria in all bodily organs -- including the brain, which antibiotics alone have difficulty reaching. The results are reported in the journal\nMolecular Medicine\n.\nThe World Health Organization has identified antibiotic resistant bacteria as a global health risk. Two important classes of antibiotic are beta-lactams (e.g. penicillin) and macrolides (e.g. erythromycin), which are used to treat life-threatening infections such as meningitis. The fact that the bacteria that cause the disease are becoming resistant is a grave concern, as the patients who have the disease -- and survive -- risk permanent brain and neurological damage.\n\"There are two main problems in meningitis -- the difficulty antibiotics have crossing the blood-brain barrier and the increase in resistant bacteria,\" says principal investigator Federico Iovino, associate professor and research group leader at the Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet. \"Our results show that with the supplementation of endolysins, we can restore the effectiveness of antibiotics, even when the bacteria are resistant.\"\nProtected human cells\nThe protein endolysin is an enzyme derived from a virus called bacteriophage, which kills bacteria by breaking down the bacterial cell. In veterinary medicine, endolysins have been proven effective against udder infections.\nIn the laboratory, the researchers found that an endolysin called cpl-1 protects human cells from blood and cerebrospinal fluid when exposed to\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n(the pneumococcus), resistant to penicillin or erythromycin. These pneumococci are the primary cause of meningitis globally. Researchers have successfully experimented endolysin combined with penicillin or erythromycin.\n\"The combination protected nerve cells from infection by resistant pneumococcal strains which have affected patients and which we have been obtained from Swedish hospitals,\" says the study's first author Niels Vander Elst, postdoctoral researcher in Federico Iovino's group. \"This was a significant result, as these are the very bacteria that cause meningitis.\"\nQuickly enters the brain\nThe researchers then used an animal model for meningitis in which mice were infected with penicillin-resistant pneumococci. While endolysin alone protected against infection, penicillin alone did not. When the mice received a combination of antibiotic and endolysin, they were protected against disease and the antibiotic recovered its effectiveness.\n\"It takes time for antibiotics to get past the blood-brain barrier, upwards of several days, but endolysin can enter the brain very quickly within a few hours,\" says Dr Iovino. \"Its speed is a unique property that's important since brain neurons start to get damaged as soon as the bacteria are present. It also has another important advantage -- it doesn't give the bacteria time to develop resistance.\"\nTests on other resistant bacteria to come\nFederico Iovino's group now intend to study the effectiveness of endolysin with other types of resistant bacteria in order that it can be used as a powerful weapon against the resistant bacteria that cause serious diseases, not least meningitis.\n\"For the first time, we've shown that endolysin is effective against the bacteria that cause meningitis,\" says Dr Iovino. \"Our data also bridge earlier gaps in our knowledge by showing that they can pass through the blood-brain barrier and help antibiotics to recover their effectiveness against resistance.\"\nThe study was financed by the Swedish Research Council, HRH Crown Princess Lovisa's Association for Paediatric Care, the Magnus Bergvall Foundation, the Åhlén Foundation, the Silent School Foundation, the Wera Ekström Fund for Paediatric Research and the Gun and Bertil Stohne Foundation.\nNiels Vander Elst has patent applications pending for the endolysin technique.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nInfectious Diseases\nPharmacology\nPharmaceuticals\nMind & Brain\nBrain Injury\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nNeuroscience\nPlants & Animals\nBacteria\nMicrobes and More\nMice\nRELATED TERMS\nPenicillin-like antibiotics\nPneumoni",
    "summary": "antibiotic resistance is a growing global threat, especially for brain infections like meningitis, where treatment is tough due to both resistant bacteria and the blood-brain barrier. new research shows that combining antibiotics with endolysin—an enzyme from viruses that break down bacteria—can restore antibiotic effectiveness, even against resistant strains. this combo quickly reaches the brain and protects nerve cells, offering new hope for tackling deadly infections and reducing the risk of long-term neurological damage. this breakthrough could change how we fight resistant bacteria in the brain and beyond. 🧠💊\n\n#neuroscience #antibioticresistance #brainhealth #innovation #scienceupdate"

Just like other brain functions, vision also depends on a balanced and controlled interaction between the chemical signals that \"activate\" and \"brake\" activity in the eye's cells -- much like the accelerator and brake of a car. In research, the \"brake\" is known as GABA, which stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid, and it is the primary neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity and helps regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain.\nNeuroscientific researchers have long been particularly interested in understanding how networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons work together. It has been a fundamental challenge to uncover how these complex interactions in neural circuits create the precise and targeted actions that underlie both vision and other cognitive processes.\nTogether with colleagues from the USA, researchers from DANDRITE have, for the first time, conducted a comprehensive functional mapping of how the \"brake\" -- inhibitory signaling -- works in the part of the eye that processes and sends electrical signals to the brain, called the retina. It is in the retina that the first visual information is processed and then transmitted to the brain.\nIn total, the researchers mapped 44 different visual cells -- some of which had never been described before. What was even more interesting was that these cells were characterized by a higher degree of systematic organization than previously known.\n\"Our result can be compared to finding a complicated map of an unknown landscape. Previously, we thought the landscape was randomly divided, but now we have mapped it, so we can see that each region has its own precise path and function,\" explains Professor Keisuke Yonehara, elaborating:\n\"By understanding how the different cells in the retina are organized and work in specific directions, we have revealed how the brain can precisely 'see' movement and orientation in our visual field -- as if they have found the most efficient route through a complex network.\"\nThe key to this discovery was the development of a new GABA sensor, created by researchers in the USA, which allows for real-time observation and mapping of the precise activity of inhibitory neurons.\nThe research group's results have just been published in the journal\nNature Neuroscience\n, and according to Keisuke Yonehara, this could be a breakthrough in understanding where and how certain eye disorders develop and occur.\n\"Many eye disorders are linked to imbalances in inhibitory signalling, including congenital nystagmus, where the eyes move involuntarily, quickly, and rhythmically. Now we have a 'map' that can give us deeper insights into this condition and hopefully also others related to this area.\"\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nEye Care\nNervous System\nBrain Tumor\nDiseases and Conditions\nMind & Brain\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nBrain Injury\nPerception\nIntelligence\nRELATED TERMS\nPeripheral vision\nEye\nVisual perception\nEye examination\nVisual acuity\nBitemporal hemianopsia\nVisual field\nSensory system\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nAarhus University\n.

These receptors potentially influence anxiety and mood disorders whose origins are still unclear.\nThe team characterized the function of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the ventral hippocampus of mice, a region involved in the regulation of emotions and stress responses. Their work expands the field's knowledge of dopamine signaling beyond its well-known actions in other brain regions that influence reward and motivation, and sets the stage for future research into dopamine dysregulation in a range of anxiety and depressive disorders. The results of the study appeared in the May 7 issue of\nNature\n.\n\"Healthy and dysregulated emotional processing related to an individual's ability to resolve conflict between approach and avoidance when making decisions on a moment-by-moment basis have long implicated the hippocampus,\" says senior author Eric J. Nestler, MD, PhD, Nash Family Professor of Neuroscience and Director of The Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Chief Scientific Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. \"Ours is the first comprehensive, functional study of newly discovered D1 and D2 expressing cells in the ventral hippocampus. We demonstrate that dopamine is more important in that area of the brain than previously believed and, moreover, that it conveys information related to decision-making under stressful conditions.\"\nThe hippocampus coordinates decision-making in anxiety-inducing situations, like when an individual has to choose whether to obtain food or drink under threatening situations. Such approach/avoidance dilemmas, where a particular goal has both desirable and potentially undesirable consequences, can cause excessive fear, confusion, and anxiety in humans.\nThe Mount Sinai team investigated the influence of dopamine signaling within the ventral hippocampus on approach/avoidance behavior in male mice. Researchers learned that D1 and D2 dopamine receptors expressed in different neuronal populations are called into play to help execute approach/avoidance decisions. These receptors and the cells that express them mediate opposite approach/avoidance responses, and are differentially impacted by dopamine transmission in that region of the brain.\nThe team was surprised to learn that the neuronal cells that express D1 and D2 receptors, which are most highly enriched in the striatum -- a critical part of the motor and reward system -- are also relevant in the hippocampus. Another unexpected behavioral observation was that mice whose D2 cells were artificially activated became much less fearful.\n\"These discoveries underscored for us that dopamine is an important component of the hippocampal circuitry and that dopamine signaling should be reconsidered in many brain regions where it was previously overlooked, especially those associated with learning, memory, and emotional behavior,\" notes Dr. Nestler, whose considerable research over the years has been designed to better understand the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression. \"Our work further implicates dopamine dysregulation in anxiety and mood disorders.\"\nDr. Nestler credits the study's two co-first authors, Arthur Godino, PhD, a graduate student and later postdoctoral fellow, and Marine Salery, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow, and the rest of the large research team for the creative advances made in this investigation.\nThe next step for Dr. Nestler and his team is to show precisely how the dopamine-hippocampus circuit that modulates approach/avoidance is dysregulated in several stress-related conditions, such as anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders (which involve increased avoidance) and in drug addiction (where individuals seek drug rewards despite harmful consequences).\n\"By helping to delineate the neuromodulatory circuits that govern these disorders,\" says Dr. Nestler, \"we're taking an essential step toward addressing a leading cause of disability in humans worldwide.\"\nThis work was funded by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and Hope for Depression Research Foundation.\nRELATED TOPICS\nMind & Brain\nDi",

Promising results have been published in the journal\nCell Reports Medicine\n. The researchers behind the study have now started a clinical trial on patients.\nIn glaucoma, the optic nerve is gradually damaged, leading to vision loss and, in the worst cases, blindness. High pressure in the eye drives the disease, and eye drops, laser treatment or surgery are therefore used to lower the pressure in the eye and thus slow down the disease. Unfortunately, however, the effect varies.\nGlaucoma researchers have long theorised that the substance homocysteine is somehow relevant to understanding the disease. Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have investigated the role of homocysteine in several ways. In the current study, the researchers discovered that when rats with glaucoma were given elevated levels of homocysteine, their disease did not worsen.\nThe researchers also found that high levels of homocysteine in the blood of people with glaucoma did not correlate with how quickly the disease progressed, and that glaucoma was not more common in people with a genetic susceptibility to forming high levels of homocysteine. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that homocysteine does not drive the disease but is a consequence of it.\nSince homocysteine is a natural part of the body's metabolism, the researchers wanted to investigate metabolic pathways involving homocysteine in both rodents and humans with glaucoma. They then saw several abnormalities, the most important of which were metabolic changes linked to the retina's ability to use certain vitamins. This change meant that metabolism was slowed down locally in the retina -- and this played a role in the development of the disease.\n'Our conclusion is that homocysteine is a bystander in the disease process, not a player. Altered homocysteine levels may reveal that the retina has lost its ability to use certain vitamins that are necessary to maintain healthy metabolism. That's why we wanted to investigate whether supplements of these vitamins could protect the retina,' says co-lead on the paper James Tribble, researcher and assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet.\nIn experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. This had a positive effect. In mice that had a slower developing glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerve was completely halted. In rats, which had a more aggressive form of the disease with faster progression, the disease was slowed down.\nIn these experiments, eye pressure was left untreated, which the researchers highlight as particularly interesting -- it suggests that the vitamin mix affects the disease in a different way than lowering eye pressure does.\n'The results are so promising that we have started a clinical trial, with patients already being recruited at S:t Eriks Eye Hospital in Stockholm,' says James Tribble.\nBoth patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (slower progression) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (faster progression) are included.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nEye Care\nHealthy Aging\nDiseases and Conditions\nChronic Illness\nMind & Brain\nAlzheimer's\nCaregiving\nHuntington's Disease\nStroke\nRELATED TERMS\nGlaucoma\nOptic nerve\nBitemporal hemianopsia\nColor blindness\nRetina\nEye\nPernicious anemia\nB vitamins\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nKarolinska Institutet\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nJames R.

Because the brain is functioning normally, as is the spinal cord below the injury, researchers have been working to re-establish the communication to allow for rehabilitation and potentially restore movement.\nIsmael Seáñez, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis and of neurosurgery at WashU Medicine, and members of his lab, including Carolyn Atkinson, a doctoral student, have developed a type of decoder to restore that communication. Through experiments in their lab with 17 human subjects without a spinal cord injury, they were able to cue movement in the lower leg with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, or noninvasive, external electrical pulses.\nResults of the research were published online April 25, 2025, in the\nJournal of Neuro Engineering and Rehabilitation\n.\nThe team used a special cap fitted with noninvasive electrodes that measure brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). While wearing the cap, seated volunteers were asked to extend their leg at the knee, then to only think about extending their leg -- while keeping it still -- so researchers could record the brain waves in both exercises.\nThe team provided the neural activity to the decoder, or algorithm, so it could learn how the brain waves act in both circumstances. They found that the actual movement and imagined movement used similar neural strategies.\n\"After we give the decoder this data, it learns to predict based on neural activity whenever there is movement or no movement,\" Seáñez said. \"We show that we can predict whenever someone is thinking about moving their leg, even if their leg does not actually move.\"\nThe team used controls to ensure that the volunteers were truly imagining movement and not actually moving.\n\"Whenever people move, this can introduce signal noise, and we want to make sure that the signal noise is not what we're learning to predict,\" Seáñez said. \"It's movement intention or brain activity that we want to predict, so we have people imagine that they're extending their leg and use the same algorithm that has been trained on people moving to predict whether they were imagining or not.\"\nSeáñez said this reveals two things.\n\"One, that it's more likely that we're decoding movement intention and not an artifact, or noise, and second, whenever we employ this on people with spinal cord injury who will not have that ability to actually move their legs for us to label the data, we could use their imagination of moving a leg to train our decoder.\"\nSeáñez said the proof-of-concept study is a first step toward developing a noninvasive brain-spine interface that uses real-time predictions to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement in a single joint in rehabilitation in patients with a spinal cord injury.\nGoing forward, the team plans to test a generalized decoder trained on data from all participants that could determine whether a universal decoder could perform as well as a personalized one and simplify its use in clinical settings.\nFunding for this research was provided by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis; the National Institutes of Health (K12-HD073945, K01-NS127936; R01-EB026439; P41-EB018783); the Department of Biomedical Engineering in McKelvey Engineering at WashU; and the Department of Neurosurgery at WashU Medicine.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nDisability\nRestless Leg Syndrome\nBone and Spine\nNervous System\nMind & Brain\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nNeuroscience\nIntelligence\nBrain Injury\nRELATED TERMS\nCentral nervous system\nBrain\nSpinal cord\nBrain damage\nTraumatic brain injury\nUmbilical cord\nMeningitis\nMultiple sclerosis\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nWashington University in St. Louis\n.

But what's really happening inside our brains when we engage in this kind of decision making?\nA University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine-led study published in\nNature Neuroscience\nsheds new light on these big questions, illuminating a general principle of neural processing in a mysterious region of the midbrain that is the very origin of our central serotonin (5-HT) system, a key part of the nervous system involved in a remarkable range of cognitive and behavioral functions.\n\"The current dominating model is that individual 5-HT neurons are acting independently one from another. While it had previously been suggested that 5-HT neurons may rather be connected with one another, it had not been directly demonstrated. That is what we did here. We also identify an intriguing processing role -- or a computation -- that is supported by this particular type of connectivity between 5-HT neurons,\" says Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, full professor in the Faculty's Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and co-director of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute's Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.\nThe international research team's work involved a mixture of several experimental approaches such as electrophysiology, cellular imaging, optogenetics and behavioral approaches, along with mathematical modeling and computer simulations.\nForging advances\nSo what does it mean that serotonin neurons clustered together in the brainstem are not independent actors largely keeping to themselves but are actually sending axons to the rest of the brain?\n\"In my view, the paper's main takeaway is that the mammalian serotonin system is far more anatomically and functionally complex than what we previously imagined. This is knowledge that could potentially help develop targeted therapeutics for mood disorders like major depressive disorder,\" says Dr. Michael Lynn, the study's first author and a former member of Dr. Béïque's Faculty of Medicine lab.\nDr. Lynn received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Ottawa in October 2023. He's now working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford, in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics.\nHe says the team's findings are important because it turns out that there are distinct groups of serotonin neurons with their own activity patterns, each controlling serotonin release in a particular region of the brain. This has implications for the \"winner-takes-all\" principle of neuroscience -- an idea applied in computational models of neural networks in which neurons essentially compete to get activated.\n\"The new principles uncovered in this paper suggest that these distinct ensembles can interact in some scenarios: 'winning' serotonin ensembles with high activity can strongly reduce serotonin release from 'losing' serotonin ensembles with lower activity levels,\" he says. \"These imply a more complex, dynamic set of rules about how and when serotonin is released throughout the brain, contrasting with an older view of a more monolithic signal.\"\nDecisions, decisions\nThe research team's work has implications for how our brain -- an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections -- is involved in day-to-day decision making.\nThey determined how the lateral habenula, a region that is activated when we are frustrated and that is implicated in major depression, ultimately controls the activity of serotonin neurons. Habenular neurons are also believed to encode the level of threat that is perceived from a particular environment, or perhaps even from our actions.\nDr. Béïque explains it like this: \"Do we jump from the high diving board at the pool? Or only from the low one? Do we walk down that very dark alley, or do we avoid it? When is dark too dark? Somehow our brain must compute features of our world -- including how threatening a particular environment is -- and come up with a binary output: you go, or you don't.\"\n\"We think we have identified a circuit that participates in that very computation that guides our everyday decisions,\" he says.\nNext steps\nWhat's next for the research team as they buil",
    "summary": "exciting new research reveals the brain’s serotonin system is far more complex than once thought 🧠✨. scientists have discovered that serotonin neurons in the midbrain aren’t just independent actors—they actually form interconnected groups, each with unique activity patterns that influence how serotonin is released across different brain regions. this dynamic “winner-takes-all” process means that active neuron groups can suppress others, adding a new layer of complexity to how our brains make decisions, especially those involving risk or threat. these insights are especially relevant now, as understanding this circuitry could lead to more targeted treatments for mood disorders like major depression. the study also highlights how regions like the lateral habenula help our brains compute and respond to challenging choices in everyday life. this breakthrough deepens our understanding of the neural roots of decision-making and mental health.\n\n#neuroscience #serotonin #mentalhealth #brainresearch #depression #science"

They also shed light on how excessive avoidance -- a hallmark symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression -- may come to be via alterations in dopamine function. This can lead to an overestimation of danger in the environment and a decreased quality of life as the brain prioritizes avoiding certain experiences. Finally, the study helps explain why the concept behind the recent \"dopamine-detox\" wellness trend is too simplistic.\n\"Dopamine is not all good or all bad,\" said first author Gabriela Lopez, a doctoral candidate in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"It rewards us for good things but also helps us tune into cues that signal trouble, learn from consequences and continuously adapt our learning strategies in unstable environments.\"\nHow the study worked\nIn the study, scientists trained mice to respond to a five-second warning cue that predicted an unpleasant outcome. If the mice moved to the other side of a two-chamber box during the warning cue, they could avoid the outcome entirely. As the mice learned the task, researchers recorded dopamine activity in two areas of the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in motivation and learning. Previous research had suggested that dopamine in the ventromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens increases during bad experiences, while dopamine in the core of the nucleus accumbens decreases. Therefore, the scientists wanted to understand how these different dopamine responses work together when the mice learn to avoid bad experiences.\nThey found that the two areas of the nucleus accumbens responded differently:\nIn the ventromedial shell, dopamine levels initially surged in response to the unpleasant event itself. As the mice actively learned about the meaning of the warning cue, the dopamine response shifted to the cue itself. Eventually, though, the dopamine response faded away as the mice became skilled at avoiding the outcome.\nIn the core, dopamine decreased for both the unpleasant event and the warning cue. The reduction in dopamine in response to the warning cue steadily increased throughout training, especially as the mice became more successful at avoiding the event.\n\"These responses are not only different in their sign -- where in one area, dopamine goes up for something bad and, in the other area, it goes down for something bad -- but we also saw that one is important for early learning while the other one is important for later-stage learning,\" said corresponding author Talia Lerner, associate professor of neuroscience and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg.\nLater, the researchers tested what would happen when the outcome couldn't be avoided, regardless of the mice's actions. Under those conditions, dopamine patterns returned to what they looked like earlier in training -- suggesting that these brain signals are sensitive to context and may help animals adapt their behavior when",
    "summary": "dopamine isn’t just about chasing rewards—it’s also key to helping us avoid negative outcomes. new research reveals that dopamine signals in different brain areas respond uniquely to bad experiences, guiding us as we learn to steer clear of danger. this study is the first to track how these signals change as we move from beginners to experts at avoiding harm. understanding this process sheds light on why some people are more prone to anxiety or excessive avoidance, as seen in conditions like ocd and depression, and challenges the simple narrative of “dopamine detox.” dopamine helps us tune into warning signs, learn from consequences, and adapt our strategies in unpredictable environments—making it a crucial player in both motivation and mental health. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #dopamine #mentalhealth #brainresearch #scienceexplained"

This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain -- and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.\nThe discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders -- from obesity to cancer -- in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.\nIn 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment. He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.\nLong-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain.\nThe researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place.\nWhile memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University). They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.\nLead author of the article published today in the journal,\nNature\n,, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4\no\nC with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts. After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature. Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were \"expecting\" the environment to be cold.\nHaving established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus. Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat. And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.\nDr Muñoz Zamora\n,\nsaid: \"We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body's metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future.\"\nProf. Lynch added: \"A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue -- or brown fat -- which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain. Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold.\"\nDr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: \"Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to te",
    "summary": "🧠❄️ new research reveals our brains form memories of cold experiences, which then help control metabolism and body temperature. scientists found that mice could “remember” the cold and boost their metabolism in anticipation, even when the actual temperature was normal. this happens through special memory cells in the brain’s hippocampus, showing a direct link between memory and metabolic regulation. why does this matter? understanding how memories influence metabolism could lead to innovative treatments for conditions like obesity and cancer, where body temperature regulation is key. this breakthrough highlights the power of our brains—not just in shaping behavior and emotions, but also in managing how our bodies respond to the environment. #neuroscience #metabolism #brainhealth #scienceupdate"

Anthony Movshon squared off at a Columbia University event over the usefulness of connectomes—maps of every connection between every cell in the brain of a living organism.\nSuch a map,\nSeung\nargued, could crack open the brain’s computations and provide insight into processes such as sensory perception and memory. But\nMovshon\n, professor of neural science and psychology at New York University, countered that the relationship between structure and function was not so straightforward—that even if you knew how all of a brain’s neurons connect to one another, you still wouldn’t understand how the organ turns electrical signals into cognition and behavior.\nThe debate in the field continues, even though Seung and his colleagues in the\nFlyWire Consortium\ncompleted the first connectome of a female\nDrosophila melanogaster\nin 2023\n,\nand even though a slew of new computational models built from that and other connectomes hint that structure does, in fact, reveal something about function.\n“This is just the beginning, and that’s what’s exciting,” says Seung, professor of neuroscience at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. “These papers are kicking off a beginning to an entirely new field, which is connectome-based brain simulation.” A simulated fruit fly optic lobe, detailed in a September 2024\nNature\npaper\n, for example, accurately predicts which neurons in living fruit flies respond to different visual stimuli.\n“All the work that’s been done in the past year or two feels like the beginning of something new,” says\nJohn Tuthill\n, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Washington. Tuthill was not involved in the optic lobe study but used a similar approach to identify a circuit that seems to control walking in flies. Most published models so far have made predictions about simple functions that were already understood from recordings of neural activity, Tuthill adds. But “you can see how this will build up to something that is eventually very insightful.”\nAnd having the connectome has shaved years off the time it takes to, say, identify a neuron involved in a particular behavior, Seung says, and narrowed the field of experiments to only those that align with the way the brain is actually connected. “You don’t have to spend months or years chasing down dead ends,” he adds. “Simulation is going to improve that even more.”\nT\nhe field of connectomics began in earnest with the mapping of the 302 neurons of the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nin 1986. Around the turn of the millennium, though, advances in electron microscopy made it possible to consider mapping significantly larger nervous systems, such as those of a fruit fly, a\nmouse\nor, ultimately, a human. Researchers could slice up a brain, image each slice, reconstruct the brain in a computer and trace each neuron’s winding path.\nBut the excitement about that possibility was almost immediately matched by reservations about the time and money involved—and concerns that the payoff might not be worth it.\nSome of those concerns were laid out in a seminal 2013\nNature Methods\ncommentary\nby neuroscientists\nEve Marder\nand\nCori Bargmann\n.\nThey wondered at the time what additional information beyond the brain’s synaptic connections—whether those connections are inhibitory or excitatory, for instance—would be needed to make truly informative models.\nMore than a decade later, fly connectome data still lack that basic information. They also don’t account for electrical synapses—connections between neurons via electrical signals shared across a cell membrane. And some cells can be connected both electrically and chemically, creating multiple potential pathways across a single circuit, Marder says. “In the absence of knowing who’s electrically coupled to who, you can make some assumptions from a chemical circuit connectome that are going to be missing a lot of parallel pathways.”\nIn its most pared-down form, a connectome represents the connections between neurons mathematically.\nIn the case of the fruit fly, each connection appears in a matrix of 139,000 or so rows and columns, each representing one of the fly’s 139,000 neurons. The cells display numbers that indicate how strongly two neurons are connected. Most contain a 0, because most pairs of neurons do not touch.\nSimulations based on such matrices must add information—or make assumptions—about types of neurons, where they are located in the brain and what kin",
    "summary": "neuroscience is entering a new era as researchers use complete brain connectivity maps—connectomes—to simulate and understand how circuits drive behavior 🧠✨. with the entire wiring diagram of the fruit fly brain now mapped, scientists are building computational models that predict how specific neurons respond to stimuli and control actions like walking. while the debate continues over how much structure alone can reveal about brain function, these simulations are already speeding up discoveries and narrowing down experiments, offering a powerful shortcut to understanding complex behaviors. challenges remain—like missing details on neuron types and electrical connections—but each advance brings us closer to decoding the brain’s mysteries. connectome-based simulations are just beginning, but their potential to transform neuroscience is huge.\n\n#neuroscience #connectomics #brainresearch #simulation #sciencenews"

Reduce the amount of non-mutant HTT and you'll create the neurological equivalent of traffic jams and roadblocks.\nNow, the researchers have learned more about what can control the traffic-controlling HTT.\nThey found that two specific signaling proteins, GSK3ß and ERK1, were expressed more in the neurons of Huntington's disease patients, so they prevented them from functioning in the neurons of fruit fly larvae that have a mutant HTT. This inhibition of GSK-3ß actually led to less defects in the axonal transport process and less neuronal cell death, while inhibiting ERK1 led to more transport problems and more cell death.\n\"With these findings, we propose that ERK1 may protect neurons in the face of Huntington's disease, while GSK3ß may exacerbate Huntington's disease,\" says Shermali Gunawardena, PhD, associate professor of biological sciences in UB's College of Arts and Sciences. \"Therapeutics may one day be able to target these signaling proteins in different ways -- inhibiting GSK3ß and boosting ERK1 -- to treat this severe and fatal neurological disorder.\"\nGunawardena is the corresponding author on a study detailing the research, which was published April 22 in Nature Cell Death & Disease.\nTwo proteins, two opposing effects\nWhen the HTT gene mutates it repeats the genetic sequences cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) too many times. Why this diminishes a person's physical and mental abilities, typically starting around middle age, remains unclear because HTT's purpose and normal function is not fully understood.\nIn what was a piece of this puzzle, Gunawardena's team previously found that HTT travels along axonal highways by hitching a ride on particular cellular cargo carriers called vesicles. These vesicles are themselves moved by motor proteins known as dyneins and kinesins.\n\"This time, we focused on the signalers that actually regulate this entire complex transport system: a group of proteins called kinases,\" said the study's first author, Thomas J. Krzystek, who received a PhD in biological sciences from UB in 2022 and is now a senior scientist at AbbVie. \"Kinases modify HTT and other transport components by attaching molecular tags to them known as phosphate groups.\"\nThe kinases GSK3ß and ERK1 caught the team's eye because they were upregulated in neurons with Huntington's disease when compared with normal neurons.\nTo understand this better in a living organism, they turned to the fruit fly. Inhibiting GSK3ß in fruit fly larvae with Huntington's disease decreased their axonal blockages and neuronal cell death. The fruit flies were even able to crawl better.\nIn a previous study, they found that GSK3ß -- short for glycogen synthase kinase-3beta -- tells motor proteins whether to stop or go, and that too much GSK-3ß or too little can disrupt the motors and cause traffic blocks by different mechanisms.\n\"So, while GSK3ß typically plays a positive role in neuronal function, it seems it may actually make a bad situation worse when faced with a mutant HTT,\" Gunawardena says.\nConversely, inhibiting ERK1 -- short for extracellular signal-related kinase -- increased axonal blockages and cell death.\n\"The level of ERK1 is clearly important for Huntington's disease, but whether it's actually modulating the mutant HTT is unclear,\" Krzystek says. \"Either way, the signaling from this ERK1 pathway is neuroprotective in the context of Huntington's disease.\"\nThe team also tried elevating the levels of ERK1 and found it decreased traffic blockages and cell death.\n\"So long as it doesn't affect other processes that ERK1 might be involved in, future treatment could potentially increase a patient's levels of ERK1 to mitigate their neuronal cell death,\" Gunawardena says. \"There's not much that can be done once cells have died, so our whole research is trying to figure out these key, early processes that lead to cell death and whether that can be prevented.\"\nThe work was supported by the National Institute of Ne",
    "summary": "new research reveals how two key proteins affect huntington’s disease: gsk3β makes things worse, while erk1 offers protection. both proteins help regulate the movement of the huntingtin protein inside neurons—think of them as traffic controllers on the brain’s highways. in fruit fly models, blocking gsk3β reduced nerve cell damage, while boosting erk1 helped prevent cell death. these findings open the door to future treatments that could target these proteins to slow or stop neurodegeneration in huntington’s disease. this breakthrough adds a vital piece to the puzzle of how huntington’s progresses, giving hope for new therapies that protect brain cells before damage becomes irreversible. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #huntingtonsdisease #brainhealth #research #hope"

When GRAMD1B levels are altered, it changes the balance of cholesterol, lipid stores and amount of modified tau in the cells, all of which are linked to brain diseases.\nThe study is published online in the journal\nNature Communications\n.\n\"Scientists know that GRAMD1B plays a role in other parts of the body like the adrenal gland and intestine but until now the protein has never been studied in the brain. The findings are exciting because by targeting GRAMD1B, we can potentially develop new therapies to help people with FTLD and Alzheimer's,\" said study corresponding author Hongjun \"Harry\" Fu, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at Ohio State.\nAbout 50,000 to 60,000 Americans live with FTLD. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. An estimated 6.9 million Americans who are age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today, according to the Alzheimer's Association's 2024 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures report.\nThe work was supported by the BrightFocus Foundation's Alzheimer's Disease Research, National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, The Ohio State University Chronic Brain Injury Discovery Theme pilot grant, and The Ohio State University Neurological Research Institute seed grant.\nThe authors disclose no conflicts of interest.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nAlzheimer's Research\nHealthy Aging\nNervous System\nElder Care\nMind & Brain\nAlzheimer's\nDementia\nDisorders and Syndromes\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nRELATED TERMS\nDementia with Lewy bodies\nAlzheimer's disease\nMulti-infarct dementia\nStem cell treatments\nCognitive neuroscience\nNeural network\nDementia\nDeep brain stimulation\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nOhio State University Wexner Medical Center\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nDiana Acosta Ingram, Emir Turkes, Tae Yeon Kim, Sheeny Vo, Nicholas Sweeney, Marie-Amandine Bonte, Ryan Rutherford, Dominic L.

The study, published April 30 in\nNature\n,\nalso describes how activating a serotonin receptor in the brain of a mouse model ofASD restored positive emotional value (also known as \"valence\"), with encouraging implications for the development of future therapies.\n\"The ability to recognize and distinguish unpleasant from pleasant interactions is essential for humans to navigate their social environment,\" says Xiaoting Wu, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and senior author of the study. \"Until now, it has been unclear how the brain assigns positivity or negativity -- 'valence' -- to social experiences, and how that information can be flexibly updated in a constantly changing environment.\"\nAt the center of this complex neural circuitry is the hippocampus, located deep in the temporal lobe of the brain and responsible for forming new memories, learning, and emotions. The Mount Sinai researchers described how two neuromodulators -- serotonin and neurotensin, which influence processes such as mood, arousal, and neural plasticity -- are released into the hippocampal subregion known as ventral CA1, where they control opposing social valence assignment. Both neurotransmitters impact distinct populations of ventral CA1 neurons through their respective receptors, serotonin 1B and neurotensin 1.\nWhile deficits in social valence are known to be prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders, their underlying neural mechanisms and pathophysiology have remained elusive. \"Through our work we've provided the first foundational insights into the neural basis of social valence,\" notes Dr. Wu. \"We have demonstrated that the neuromodulators serotonin and neurotensin signal opposing valence, revealing a fundamental principle of brain function in the form of a neuromodulatory switch that allows behavioral adaptation based on social history.\"\nSpecifically, the team developed a novel social cognitive paradigm that involved exposing mice to negative and positive social encounters. In the negative social encounter, the test mouse was exposed to a mean/aggressive mouse; in the positive encounter, the mouse was exposed to a potential mate. In both assays the mice had negative or neutral/positive or neutral interaction and then got to choose which mouse they would like to spend more time with. Without prior experience, the mice did not have a preference, but with the experience, they associated a mouse with a positive or negative valence and then learned to avoid the \"bad\" mouse or approach the \"good\" mouse.\"\nJust as importantly, the team uncovered specific drug targets for positive and negative valence, knowledge that could potentially factor into future treatments. Specifically, serotonin acting on the serotonin 1B receptor generates a positive impression of a social encounter, while neurotensin acting on the neurotensin 1 receptor creates a negative impression. Imbalanced emotional processing of those two social experiences is known to be a debilitating symptom of ASD. Consequently, by activating the serotonin 1B receptor, researchers were able to restore a positive impression associated with rewarding social experiences.\n\"We identified a specific neuromodulator receptor which we then targeted to rescue social cognitive deficits in a mouse model of ASD,\" Dr. Wu explains. \"On a broader scale, our work provides critical insights into complex social behaviors while revealing potential therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to improve social cognitive deficits in common neuropsychiatric disorders.\"\nThis work was supported by funding from NIH K99 Career Development Award (grant no.

    "summary": "how does the brain decide if a social interaction feels good or bad? 🧠 new research reveals that two key neuromodulators—serotonin and neurotensin—work in the hippocampus to assign positive or negative “valence” to social experiences. this balance helps us learn from and adapt to our social world, while imbalances are linked to neuropsychiatric conditions like autism and schizophrenia. by targeting specific serotonin receptors in mice, scientists were able to restore positive social feelings, pointing to promising new directions for therapies. this discovery is a major step in understanding the neural roots of social behavior and could lead to better treatments for social deficits. 🌟\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #brainresearch #socialbehavior #autism #innovation"

Moreover, when two animals are together, they typically freeze at the same time, matching each other's periods of immobility.\nIn a new study, researchers found that coordination during fear looks different in males and females -- and changes when stress is involved.\nMale-female mouse pairs consistently stayed in sync during stressful situations, even when the animals were strangers. Same-sex pairs were more likely to fall out of step.\nThe findings, published in\nBiological Psychiatry Global Open Science\n, suggest that opposite-sex pairs may rely on a more flexible or complex coordination strategy -- one that doesn't break down under emotional pressure.\n\"Opposite-sex pairs showed a surprising resilience,\" said Alexei Morozov, assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and corresponding author of the study. \"They synchronized their fear responses regardless of emotional context. And unlike same-sex pairs, they didn't seem to rely on one clear strategy to do it.\"\nAlthough the research was conducted in mice, the study may offer clues about how sex and emotional context shape social behavior in other species, including people.\nExperts say the findings may shed light on the brain mechanisms involved in conditions like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"This clever and well-designed study offers a new way to measure how animals synchronize their fear responses -- and shows that males and females do it differently,\" said Vadim Bolshakov, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and at McLean Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \"It highlights the complex interaction between social and emotional signals in stressful moments. The reported findings are unique and could potentially help inform strategies to support people who struggle with fear and stress regulation.\"\nIn the study, mice learned to associate a sound with a mild but unpleasant stimulus. Later, when they heard the tone again, they froze. By observing how pairs of mice froze and moved together, the researchers were able to measure how closely their behaviors aligned.\nSame-sex pairs showed distinct coordination styles. Males tended to copy each other's actions -- when one froze or moved, the other followed.\nFemales behaved differently, becoming more responsive to their partners. If they initiated an action and their partner didn't respond in the same way, they often stopped and corrected their own behavior.\n\"Males copy. Females self-correct,\" Morozov said. \"Both strategies can get you to the same place -- synchronization -- but they're built on different kinds of social processing. If you have male and female together, somehow, they form a strong social unit against stress.\"\nMixed-sex pairs remained unaffected by stress and continued to synchronize at a high level, regardless of familiarity.\nResearch Assistant Professor Wataru Ito was the first author of the study, which included Andrew Holmes of the Laboratory of Behavioral and Genomic Neuroscience of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\nThe study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health and the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute's Seale Innovation Fund.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nMental Health Research\nErectile Dysfunction\nPsychology Research\nSexual Health\nMind & Brain\nGender Difference\nAnxiety\nPsychiatry\nStress\nRELATED TERMS\nGreen Iguana\nFear\nUrology\nHouse mouse\nAdult stem cell\nStem cell treatments\nAmygdala\nMouse\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nVirginia Tech\n.

These pathologies are notoriously difficult to prevent or effectively treat due to a complex interplay of genetics, lifestyle, co-infection, and many other factors impacting everything from diagnosis to treatment.\nWhile a comprehensive cure-all to these neurological conditions is unlikely, scientists are making headway into understanding their fundamental characteristics with the hope of preventing or alleviating cognitive and motor impairments. In a new study published in\nScience Advances,\nresearchers from the Molecular Neuroscience Unit and the former Cellular and Molecular Synaptic Function Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have now discovered that ATP, which is most commonly thought of as the 'fuel' of our cells, plays a surprising role in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. \"We found that ATP regulates protein condensation and the overall viscosity of cytoplasm in neurons,\" says Dr. Laurent Guillaud, lead author of the study. When the cytoplasm in axons -- or the axoplasm -- is more viscous, proteins are more prone to aggregate, which can lead to harmful tangles that damage the cells. \"Through both\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\ntrials, we found that boosting ATP production decreases cytosolic viscosity in affected cells, dispersing existing and preventing future pathological protein aggregations.\"\nIn many neurodegenerative diseases, one common symptom is the formation and accumulation of insoluble, membrane-less protein condensates via a process known as liquid-liquid phase separation. These protein aggregates can accumulate both inside and later outside the cells. For example, in late-stage Alzheimer's disease, these may appear as neurofibrillary tangles.\nRecent research has shown that ATP may play a direct role in regulating protein solubilization\nin vitro\nand cytoplasmic viscosity in yeast cells, acting as an important hydrotropic agent: a compound that increases the solubility of other, poorly water-soluble substances -- including various proteins. Now, through their\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\nexperiments on human stem cell-derived neurons from both healthy and Parkinson's and ALS patients, the team observed a direct relationship between the intracellular concentration of ATP and the solubility of the axoplasm and of proteins normally associated with neurodegenerative disorders, like SNCA in Parkinson's, Tau in Alzheimer's, and TDP-43 in ALS.\n\"Mammalian cells normally have an average ATP concentration of four to eight millimolar, which is surprisingly high, as the total concentration of ATP needed for all energy processes in the cell is only in the few hundreds of micromolar -- an order of magnitude lower. This led us to focus on and examine the possible hydrotropic role of ATP in neurons, from which we found a remarkable correlation between the intracellular concentration of ATP and the axoplasmic viscosity in both physiological and pathological conditions,\" explains Dr. Guillaud. For example, the researchers showed that in physiological conditions, local variations in ATP can also affect the viscosity of the cytosol, of synaptic vesicles and of active zones in the presynaptic compartment, changing the functional organization of the synapse.\nATP is largely produced by mitochondria, and mitochondrial functions and the rate of ATP synthesis naturally declines throughout our lifespan. Problems arise when other factors negatively affect mitochondrial health such as in Parkinson's disease or ALS, which can lead to further reduction in the concentration of ATP, thereby decreasing the solubility of proteins and rendering the cytoplasm more viscous. As part of their experiments, the researchers found that boosting ATP production using NMN rescued cytosolic fluidity by breaking up and solubilizing existing protein aggregates in axons from ALS neurons.\nResearch into neurodegenerative diseases is highly complex given their multifaceted nature and while we are far from a comprehensive cure, key findings as reported by the researchers here",
    "summary": "new research reveals that atp, the molecule best known as our cellular “fuel,” has a powerful new role in brain health. scientists have discovered that atp helps prevent the clumping of proteins linked to parkinson’s and als by keeping the inside of neurons more fluid. when atp levels drop—something that happens naturally with age or in disease—proteins can stick together, leading to the damaging tangles seen in many neurodegenerative conditions. by boosting atp production, researchers were able to break up these harmful clumps and restore healthier cell function in neurons from patients with parkinson’s and als. this breakthrough deepens our understanding of brain disease and opens new possibilities for future therapies aimed at maintaining atp levels to protect against neurodegeneration. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #parkinsons #als #brainhealth #research #neurodegeneration"

The reason why handedness is associated with these disorders is probably because both are affected by processes in early brain development. Various studies have explored this link for individual disorders and have sometimes been able to show it, and sometimes not. A meta-analysis carried out by an international research team from Bochum, Hamburg, Nijmegen and Athens shows that left and mixed-handedness is particularly common in people who suffer from a disorder that manifests itself early in life and is associated with linguistic symptoms. These include dyslexia, schizophrenia and autism. They published their findings in the journal\nPsychological Bulletin\non May, 2, 2025.\nSymptoms as starting point\nThe research team re-evaluated existing meta-analyses from a new perspective. \"We suspected that left- and mixed- handedness could be associated with disorders whose symptoms are related to language,\" explains Dr. Julian Packheiser from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at Ruhr University Bochum. \"Language, like handedness, has a very one-sided location in the brain, so it stands to reason that the development of both and their disorders could be linked.\" The researchers also suspected that left-handedness and mixed-handedness could be associated with diseases that occur very early in life. This is because handedness is also determined at a very early developmental stage.\n\"Both hypotheses have been confirmed,\" says Professor Sebastian Ocklenburg from the Medical School Hamburg. For example, left-handedness and mixed-handedness are statistically significantly more common in people with dyslexia -- a reading disorder -- than in healthy individuals. Autism, which in severe cases is accompanied by communication disorders, and schizophrenia, in which patients sometimes hear voices, are also associated with both linguistic symptoms and a higher incidence of left-handedness and mixed-handedness.\nLink between handedness and neurodevelopmental disorders\nConsistent with the hypothesis, the earlier the symptoms manifest, the more frequent the accumulation of left and mixed- handedness was found to be. \"In people with depression, which on average occurs around the age of 30, we couldn't show any connection,\" points out Julian Packheiser.\nThe researchers believe this is evidence that handedness and various neuronal developmental disorders are influenced by partially overlapping processes in early brain development.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nParkinson's Research\nMental Health Research\nBirth Defects\nChildren's Health\nMind & Brain\nLearning Disorders\nAutism\nSleep Disorders\nChild Development\nRELATED TERMS\nLeft-handed\nAsperger syndrome\nMental illness\nNeurology\nSocial cognition\nSleep disorder\nRett syndrome\nPersonality disorder\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nRuhr-University Bochum\n.

Along with a team at NeuRA's Centre for Pain IMPACT, they published their results today in\nJAMA Network Open\n.\nThe trial showed that enhancing the brain's capacity for emotional processing through therapeutic intervention is an effective approach to managing chronic pain.\n\"By changing how we manage emotions, it is possible to change the experience of pain itself,\" Prof. Gustin says. \"This is not just a temporary relief but a potential long-term improvement in quality of life for those affected by chronic pain.\"\nProf. Gustin and Dr Norman-Nott developed\nPain and Emotion Therapy\n-- a novel and emerging eHealth intervention. The therapy aims to retrain the brain to more easily process emotions by improving an individual's ability to deescalate negative emotions and enhance positive ones.\nThe trial took place from March 2023 to September 2024 and focused on the experiences of 89 people with chronic pain. The authors say the results could lead to new ways of treating chronic pain, emphasising the profound impact of emotional health on physical wellbeing.\nThe online therapy, made available through the trial, is the first of its kind, delivered through eight group-based therapist-guided sessions by video conference across Australia. Participants also used an app and handbook for self-learning. The control group continued their usual treatment.\nProf. Gustin says those who received the new treatment reported better emotional regulation as well as pain reduction equal to a 10-point decrease on a 100-point scale for pain intensity within a six-month follow up.\n\"This shows not only a clinical improvement, but one that makes a noticeable difference in the daily lives of the people affected,\" she says.\nUnderstanding chronic pain\nChronic pain, defined as pain lasting longer than three months, affects around 30% of people globally. The economic costs are estimated to be higher than that of heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined.\nDeclining mental health is also widespread, with up to 80% of people with chronic pain experiencing depression and anxiety. In addition, suicide rates are two to three times higher than those of the general population.\n\"A key factor in disease progression is the inability to regulate negative emotions,\" Prof. Gustin says. \"This is disrupted by the impact of persistent pain on the brain's emotional circuitry. The resulting emotion dysregulation is an ill-understood and undertreated aspect of chronic pain, which we addressed in this trial.\"\nStudy participant Jabez Allies has had chronic back pain for 10 years. She says chronic pain affects her emotions.\n\"It makes me feel more worried, moody and frustrated, which in turn affects my pain. The more negative emotions I have, the worse my pain is, and vice versa,\" she says.\nProf. Gustin says this cycle of worsening pain and increasing negative emotions is a common presentation.\n\"It shows us that chronic pain really does have a considerable effect on how people feel and the level of pain they experience.\"\nA boost to traditional treatments\nDr Norman Nott says that in the past 50-60 years, the model of chronic pain has shifted focus.\n\"We've gone from purely medical and biological approaches to a more holistic treatment model that includes addressing social and psychological experiences,\" Dr Norman Nott says.\nShe says while prescription and non-prescription pain medications continue to play an important role in treatment, they have limitations.\n\"I'm thinking particularly of side effects and diminishing efficacy over time. Opioids, specifically, present considerable issues with dependency and declining effectiveness.\"\nShe says, \"though psychological therapies come with few side effects, we know there are still improvements needed, particularly to address the key mental health concerns of people with chronic pain, such as identifying and expressing emotions, and calming down emotional reactiveness.\n\"The focus on training for emotional regulation appears to be the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle of chronic pain treatment.\n\"This is why we created this therapy -- to focus on emotion processing by improving how people manage their emotions.\"\nRichard Beaumont is a participant who has had cancer pain and chronic lower back pain for 11 year",
    "summary": "exciting news for chronic pain sufferers: new research shows that retraining the brain to better process and regulate emotions can significantly reduce pain intensity and improve quality of life. 🧠✨ this innovative online therapy, developed by australian neuroscientists, helps people break the cycle of pain and negative emotions by teaching skills to boost positive feelings and manage stress. with so many living with chronic pain—and its impact on mental health—this breakthrough highlights the powerful connection between emotional wellbeing and physical health. a fresh, neuroscience-backed approach to pain management is here, offering hope beyond traditional medications.\n\n#neuroscience #chronicpain #mentalhealth #painmanagement #brainhealth"

A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit. The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn't.\n\"Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,\" said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author Susumu Tonegawa, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.\nIn 2020 Tonegawa's lab showed that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that's no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain's amygdala region. When a mouse learns that a place is \"dangerous\" (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2. When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn't recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread. Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.\nIn the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories. The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nshow that it's dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).\n\"Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,\" said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm. \"We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn't just about suppressing it -- it's a positive learning process powered by the brain's reward machinery. This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.\"\nForgetting fear\nThe VTA was the lab's prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them. The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect. They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.\nThe circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine? The team showed that indeed they express \"D1\" receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.\nDopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment. On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet. On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn't experience any new shocks -at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes. On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.\nThe dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anti",
    "summary": "new research reveals how our brains know when it's safe to let go of fear. scientists discovered that dopamine—a brain chemical often linked to reward—signals specific neurons in the amygdala to help us \"unlearn\" fear once danger has passed. this process, observed in mice, shows that fear extinction isn't just about suppressing fear, but is an active, positive learning experience powered by our brain's reward system.\n\nthese findings are especially relevant to neuroscience today, offering fresh insight into how fear-related disorders like ptsd may be treated. by understanding how dopamine circuits help the brain move from anxiety to calm, we edge closer to therapies that could help people reclaim peace after trauma.\n\n🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #dopamine #fear #mentalhealth #ptsd #brainresearch"

A relevant question is yet to understand how such architecture naturally emerges and is sustained over time, given the plastic nature of the brain’s wiring. Following evidences that the sensory cortices organize into assemblies under selective stimuli, it has been shown that stable neuronal assemblies can emerge due to targeted stimulation, embedding various forms of synaptic plasticity in presence of homeostatic and/or control mechanisms. Here, we show that simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, based only on pre- and post-synaptic spike times, can also lead to the stable encoding of memories in the absence of any control mechanism. We develop a model of spiking neurons, trained by stimuli targeting different sub-populations. The model satisfies some biologically plausible features: (i) it contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian STDP; (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the neurons are allowed to fire spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of two inhibitory STDP sub-populations allows for the formation of stable modules in the network, with each sub-population playing a distinctive role. The Hebbian sub-population controls for the firing activity, while the anti-Hebbian neurons promote pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state. This post-learning activity is associated with spontaneous memory recalls which turn out to be fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memories. Due to its simplicity, the introduced model can represent a test-bed for further investigations on the role played by STDP on memory storing and maintenance.\nAuthor summary\nOne of the most remarkable qualities of the brain is its capacity to learn and adapt. How the learning process imprints and maintains memories, by shaping the architecture of connectivity among neurons in a constantly changing and dynamic environment, is a major question of neuroscience. Here, we explore the idea that the segregation of inputs received by a neural network, with inputs targeting distinct populations, is a key factor for shaping the architecture of the network. We find that the presence of inhibitory neurons is necessary for the emergence and the long-term maintenance of modularity in spiking neural networks with plasticity. In particular, we show that two different inhibitory sub-populations, one subject to Hebbian and the other to anti-Hebbian plasticity, are required to promote the formation of feedback and feed-forward inhibition circuits controlling memory consolidation. On one side, these inhibitory circuits favour long-term memory consolidation by inducing spontaneous memory recalls in the asynchronous irregular resting phase. On another side, the number of inhibitory neurons controls the maximal memory capacity of the considered model.\nCitation:\nBergoin R, Torcini A, Deco G, Quoy M, Zamora-López G (2025) Emergence and maintenance of modularity in neural networks with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian inhibitory STDP.

    "summary": "how does the brain organize itself to balance specialized and integrated functions? 🧠 this new research explores how modular neural networks—essential for learning and memory—can naturally emerge and persist through simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules. by modeling networks with both hebbian and anti-hebbian inhibitory neurons, the study shows that these two types of inhibition are crucial: hebbian inhibition manages activity levels, while anti-hebbian inhibition sharpens pattern selectivity. after learning, the network enters a dynamic “resting” state, where spontaneous memory recalls help consolidate long-term memories. this work highlights the importance of inhibitory neurons in shaping brain connectivity and offers a simple, biologically inspired model for studying how memories are stored and maintained over time. these insights are especially relevant as neuroscience seeks to unravel the mechanisms behind memory and adaptability in both natural and artificial neural systems.\n\n#neuroscience #memory #brainplasticity #synapticplasticity #computationalneuroscience"

Chronic pain is one of the strongest predictors of alcohol relapse, yet it's often overlooked in AUD treatment strategies. People with AUD frequently experience mechanical allodynia as well, a condition in which even light touch is perceived as painful. This sensitivity can persist during abstinence and contribute to ongoing alcohol use and relapse.\n\"Our findings highlight the therapeutic value of apremilast to reduce co-occurring drinking and mechanical allodynia in long-term abstinence -- a critical component of harmful drinking and AUD psychopathology,\" says senior author Marisa Roberto, a professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research.\nCurrently FDA-approved for treating psoriasis (a chronic autoimmune skin condition) and psoriatic arthritis (a related joint disease), apremilast has previously been shown to reduce alcohol drinking in both mice and humans. The new study builds on that work by examining whether apremilast could also ease pain linked to alcohol exposure.\nTo investigate, the research team tested apremilast in a type of rat genetically predisposed to higher alcohol consumption and in a standard genetic strain of rats. Both rat strains were given access to alcohol and treated with either apremilast or a placebo.\nApremilast significantly reduced alcohol intake across strains and biological sexes. It also decreased pain sensitivity in most groups, both immediately after drinking and during abstinence -- ranging from 24 hours to four weeks after alcohol had been removed.\n\"But at specific time points, the patterns of reduction differed between males and females, as well as between strains,\" notes first author Bryan Cruz, a postdoctoral fellow at Scripps Research. For example, the pain-relieving effects of apremilast weren't observed in some of the male rats, underscoring the importance of considering biological sex in future studies.\nIn another set of experiments, apremilast increased GABAergic transmission -- a type of inhibitory signaling that helps regulate pain and stress -- in the central amygdala, a cerebral region involved in both addiction and pain. This effect was only observed in the standard strain of rats, suggesting that apremilast's impact on brain signaling may depend on genetic background or vulnerability to AUD.\nIn both strains of male rats, alcohol exposure increased expression of PDE4 genes in the brain, further supporting a link between inflammation, pain and compulsive alcohol use. While other PDE4 inhibitors have been studied for pain unrelated to alcohol consumption, apremilast may offer a path toward more personalized therapies for those with both AUD and pain. But clinical research is still needed to determine the drug's efficacy for such conditions in humans.\nGoing forward, the researchers also plan to explore whether apremilast can mitigate anxiety and other negative emotional states that commonly emerge during alcohol withdrawal.\n\"For over a decade, it's been well-established that withdrawal-induced anxiety is a major driver of relapse,\" points out Roberto. \"Therefore, addressing other key components of the addiction cycle is critical, as many individuals use alcohol to cope not only with physical pain but with emotional distress as well.\"\nThis work was supported by funding from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (grants AA027700, AA013498, P60 AA006420, AA017447, AA021491, AA029841, K99 AA030609, T32 AA007456, K99 AA031718, AA013519 and AA010760); the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (grant I01 BX004699); and the Schimmel Family Chair.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nPain Control\nJoint Pain\nArthritis\nWorkplace Health\nMind & Brain\nAlcoholism\nAddiction\nDisorders and Syndromes\nCaregiving\nRELATED TE",

Mass General Brigham researchers have identified a potential strategy to protect against Alzheimer's disease by increasing the clusterin protein (CLU). Their results, published in\nNeuron\n, uncover the mechanism of how increased CLU protects the brain from amyloid plaques and loss of synapses, key aspects of the disease pathology, while also identifying which individuals are most likely to respond based on their genetics.\n\"Increasing clusterin has the potential to prevent cognitive decline in a way that is different than and complementary to anti-amyloid therapies to promote brain resilience,\" said Tracy Young-Pearse, PhD, the Dennis J. Selkoe Endowed Chair in Neurology and Vice Chair of Neuroscience Research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. \"Clusterin may also be beneficial for other brain diseases of aging given the mechanism we uncovered in our study.\"\nYoung-Pearse and the research team, with lead author Alexandra M. Lish of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, used several different models, including brain tissue from over 700 participants of the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Projects, human brain cell models, and animal models to uncover CLU's molecular role. They found that reduction in CLU is associated with heightened inflammation. Increased CLU protected against these inflammatory interactions, particularly between brain cells called astrocytes and microglia. The findings consistently support the therapeutic hypothesis that increasing CLU in patients with amyloid plaques and tau tangles can prevent inflammatory signaling, protecting against neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The researchers note that increasing CLU may also be beneficial for treating other age-related brain diseases, many of which share similar mechanisms of neuroinflammatory dysregulation.\nThe findings of CLU's neuroprotective effects have important implications for design and testing of new complementary therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease, according to the researchers.\n\"As amyloid accumulates in the brain, some individuals can mount a protective response by efficiently upregulating CLU, which helps preserve synapses and prevent cognitive decline. In others, this response is impaired, leading to insufficient CLU production, heightened inflammation, and progression toward Alzheimer's disease,\" said Young-Pearse.\nAuthorship: In addition to Young-Pearse and Lish, Mass General Brigham authors include Elyssa Grogan, Courtney Benoit, Richard Pearse II, Sarah Heuer, Gwendolyn Orme, Paige Galle, Kellianne Alexander, Seeley Fancher, and Andrew Stern.

Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that the immune system can influence stress and fear behaviors by changing how brain cells communicate. The investigators further showed that psychedelic treatments could target these neuroimmune interactions and reduce stress-induced fear in preclinical models and found similar results in human tissue samples. Results are published in\nNature\n.\n\"Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions,\" said corresponding author Michael Wheeler, PhD, of the Gene Lay Institute of Immunology and Inflammation as well as the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. \"This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and depression.\"\nPrior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the ways that specific immune mechanisms can also affect behaviors due to chronic stress or MDD remained unclear.\nUsing a mouse model of chronic stress, the researchers determined that increased crosstalk between cells in the amygdala, or the brain's fear center, boosted fear behaviors, elevated inflammatory signaling, and activated fear-promoting amygdala neurons.\nFurthermore, inflammatory immune cells called monocytes migrated from other parts of the body to the brain meninges during chronic stress. The research team demonstrated that artificially manipulating these cells impacted fear behaviors. Treating stressed mice with psilocybin and MDMA prevented monocytes from accumulating in the brain and lowered fear behaviors.\nThe investigators found similar signals of response to stress in human brain cells and in gene expression datasets from patients with MDD, suggesting that the same interactions between the immune system and the brain may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. The authors note that further experiments are needed to understand exactly how psychedelics affect immune cells and brain communication.\nNext steps include examining the long-term effects of psychedelic treatment on patients with MDD or inflammatory diseases. Wheeler is currently collaborating with investigators from the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics on a clinical trial of patients with depression who are being treated with psychedelics and will examine their tissue samples.\n\"We're not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition,\" said Wheeler. \"But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments.\"\nRELATED TOPICS\nMind & Brain\nAnxiety\nDisorders and Syndromes\nDepression\nMental Health\nNeuroscience\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nBrain Injury\nPsychedelic Drugs\nRELATED TERMS\nFear\nAnxiety\nAmygdala\nNeurobiology\nStress (medicine)\nMultiple sclerosis\nCulture of fear\nSocial psychology\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nBrigham and Women's Hospital\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nElizabeth N.

This technique allows detailed investigation of NTS activity and offers broad potential for advancing our understanding of brain--body--mind interactions, as well as informing therapeutic strategies for psychiatric and neurological disorders.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nThe communication between the brain and bodily organs is fundamental to emotion regulation and overall mental health. The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the brainstem is a critical hub structure mediating this interaction via the vagus nerve. Despite its importance, the NTS's deep location has historically posed challenges for observation in living animals.\nIn a study recently published in\nCell Reports Methods\n(April 4, 2025), the research team has developed the live NTS imaging method (named \"D-PSCAN,\" or Double-Prism-based brainStem imaging under Cerebellar Architecture and Neural circuits). This novel deep-brain imaging technique enables high-resolution, minimally invasive visualization of the NTS neural activity in living mice.\nNew Minimally Invasive Technique Unveiled.\nThe D-PSCAN method is based on the double microprism assembly carefully and systematically implanted between the cerebellum and brainstem, preserving cerebellar function while providing a broad and detailed view of the NTS.\n\"One major challenge in studying the NTS is its deep location beneath the cerebellum, which has made observation in living animals difficult.\" explains lead author Masakazu Agetsuma. \"Previously, some approaches involved removing the cerebellum to access the NTS, but this posed a major limitation: the cerebellum, major motor coordination center, has also been recognized as important for emotional regulation. Therefore, a method to observe the NTS while preserving cerebellar function has been needed.\"\nDetailed activity of the NTS can now be observed.\nThe research team evaluated the D-PSCAN method by investigating the NTS's response to the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, which conveys signals from internal organs to the NTS. They observed the specific thresholds of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) intensity required to elicit neural responses in the NTS. They also observed that varying stimulation parameters causes distinct patterns of neural activation, including sensitization or, conversely, inhibitory effects.\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been clinically used for drug-resistant epilepsy and is currently under investigation as a treatment for depression and other psychiatric and neurological disorders. Therefore, these results highlight the potential of the D-PSCAN method for gaining valuable insights into optimizing VNS parameters for therapeutic applications.\nTo further investigate NTS function under more physiological conditions than electrical stimulation, the research team applied the D-PSCAN method to examine its response to the gut hormone cholecystokinin, which is naturally released after feeding. As a result, they successfully detected NTS neural activity evoked by cholecystokinin.\nFuture prospects\n\"The brain-body interaction plays a critical role in emotion regulation, and gaining a deeper understanding of this function is expected to contribute both to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and to the advancement of mental health and well-being.\" says Agetsuma. \"The D-PSCAN can offer a new approach to elucidate brain-body-mind interactions, and represents a valuable research tool for basic neuroscience to clinical applications.\"\nThe implications of this research extend beyond the study of emotion regulation. The NTS receives input from various organs, including the heart and gut, and is involved in diverse functions such as appetite regulation, energy metabolism, and gut microbiota. The in vivo NTS imaging technique developed in this study, D-PSCAN, is expected to be widely applied across these research areas.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nNervous System\nMedical Devices\nMental Health Research\nPsychology Research\nMind & Brain\nDepression\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nNeuroscience\nDisorders and Syndromes\nRELATED TERMS\nFunctional neuroimaging\nPositron emission tomography\nMinimally invasive procedure\nTransmission electron microscopy\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nInterventional radiology\nLaparoscopic surgery\nBrain damage\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nNational Institutes of Natural Sciences\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nMasakazu Agetsuma, Azumi Hatakeyama, Daisuke Yamada, Hiroshi Kuniishi, Chihiro Ito",

In the affected areas, nerve cells and their layer structures are arranged in an atypical manner, which often makes drug therapy more difficult. A research team from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and the University of Bonn, in collaboration with the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), has now found evidence of profound changes in the dopamine system in FCD type 2. The results have now been published in the medical journal\nBrain\n.\nDopamine is a central neurotransmitter that regulates attention, learning and the excitability of neuronal networks, among other things. Whether and how this system is affected by FCD has so far remained largely unclear. The current study shows that the dopaminergic supply in the affected brain areas is altered. In addition, an increased expression of certain dopamine receptors was observed -- both in human tissue and in a corresponding mouse model.\nEvidence of disturbed modulation in the developing cortex\n\"Our data suggest a disrupted dopaminergic system in FCD type 2,\" explains Norisa Meli, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn at the Institute for Reconstructive Neurobiology at the UKB and first author of the study. \"Particularly striking was the significantly increased expression of dopaminergic receptors in the neurons that are central role to the disease process.\"\nThese changes could play a role in the development of epileptic seizures -- and possibly also explain why many sufferers also experience concentration problems or mood swings.\n\"Dopamine modulates the excitability of neuronal networks and their formation in the developing cortex,\" emphasizes Prof. Sandra Blaess, Professor of Neurodevelopment at UKB and member of the TRA 'Life & Health' at the University of Bonn. \"Our results show that this modulation may be disturbed in FCD type 2 -- an aspect that has hardly been investigated to date.\"\nProf. Albert Becker, Head of Department at the Institute for Cellular Neuroscience II at the UKB and also a member of the TRA \"Life & Health\" at the University of Bonn, adds: \"These findings broaden our understanding of the complex neuropathology of dysplasias. They provide important clues for new potential therapeutic approaches that could go beyond the mere control of seizures.\"\nThe study combines comprehensive molecular analyses of human tissue samples with a preclinical mouse model that replicates the genetic changes in FCD type 2. The researchers hope that these results will contribute to more targeted and effective treatment strategies in the long term.The work was funded by the German Research Foundation, the BONFOR program of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn, the iBehave project (Netzwerke 2021 -- an initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia). In addition, the work was supported by the Epilepsy Surgery Biobank of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn and the Open Access funding of the University of Bonn.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nEpilepsy Research\nNervous System\nPersonalized Medicine\nDiabetes\nMind & Brain\nEpilepsy\nNeuroscience\nParkinson's\nSchizophrenia\nRELATED TERMS\nVisual cortex\nEpilepsy\nAdult stem cell\nNeocortex (brain)\nElectroconvulsive therapy\nGene therapy\nDopamine\nThalamus\nStory Source:\nMaterials\nprovided by\nUniversitatsklinikum Bonn\n.\nNote: Content may be edited for style and length.\nJournal Reference\n:\nNorisa Meli, Katherine Sheran, Julika Pitsch, Sabine Krabbe, Valeri Borger, Tobias Baumgartner, Albert Becker, Sandra Blaess.\nAlterations in dopaminergic innervation and receptors in focal cortical dysplasia\n.\nBrain\n, 2025; DOI:\n10.1093/brain/awaf080\nCite This Page\n:\nMLA\nAPA\nChicago\nUniversitatsklinikum Bonn. \"How disturbed signaling pathways could promote epileptic seizures.\" ScienceDaily.

The findings mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nAn experiment seven years in the making has uncovered new insights into the nature of consciousness and challenges two prominent, competing scientific theories: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). The findings were published today in\nNature\nand mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness.\nIIT suggests that consciousness emerges when information inside a system (like the brain) is highly connected and unified, for as long as the information is consciously perceived, acting as a single whole. On the other hand, GNWT suggests a network of brain areas will spotlight important pieces of information in the brain -- bringing it to the forefront of our minds -- broadcasting it widely the moment it enters consciousness, and this produces conscious experience. The two competing theories were tested against one another in 2019 in a collaborative experiment involving 256 human subjects, and the findings were just released.\n\"Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute's mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,\" said Christof Koch, Ph.D., meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute. \"Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.\"\nThe Findings\nResearch showed that there's functional connection between neurons in early visual areas of the brain (the areas that process vision, which are at the back of the brain) and the frontal areas of the brain, helping us understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts. The findings de-emphasize the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it's important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception. In other words, intelligence is about doing while consciousness is about being.\nThis discovery has implications for how we understand consciousness and may shed light on disorders of consciousness such as comas or vegetative states. Identifying where consciousness comes from could help detect \"covert consciousness\" in unresponsive patients with severe injuries -- a condition known to occur in about one-quarter of cases as reported in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine\nlast year.\nNeither Theory Came Out on Top\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT) says consciousness comes from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work together to integrate information, like teamwork. It arises from how these parts are connected and how they share information with each other rather than any one individual area or part of the brain generating consciousness. The study, however, did not find enough lasting connections in the back of the brain to support this idea. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) supports the idea that consciousness happens in the front of the brain, but the study didn't find enough support for this idea either.\n\"It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory. The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another,\" said Anil Seth, Ph.D., a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex. \"Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable -- much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from.\nThe study involved 256 subjects, which is unprecedented for this kind of experiment. Researchers showed them various visual stimuli and then used three common human brain measurement tools that track blood flow as well as magnetic and electrical activity to study their brains while they looked at the stimuli.\nThe highly collaborative experiment is the result of a large-scale, open science collaboration that began at a workshop at the Allen Institute in 2018. This innovative approach brought together researchers with differing perspectives to test two theories in a collaborative, yet critical, environment aimed at reducing confirmation bias and accelerating scientific progress.\n\"Adversarial collab",
    "summary": "a groundbreaking 7-year study just challenged our understanding of consciousness, putting two leading theories—integrated information theory and global neuronal workspace theory—to the test. researchers found that conscious experience may be more tied to sensory processing in the back of the brain, rather than the prefrontal cortex, which is more about reasoning and planning. neither theory fully explained the data, but the findings bring us closer to unraveling where consciousness comes from and could help diagnose hidden awareness in unresponsive patients. this collaborative experiment marks a major step for neuroscience, showing how teamwork and open science can push the boundaries of what we know about the mind 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #consciousness #brainresearch #scienceupdate"

However, there are moments that are seemingly devoid of reportable content, referred to as mind blanking,\" writes the research team, which formed as a result of collaboration at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness in Amsterdam in 2022. \"It remains unclear what these blanks represent, highlighting the definitional and phenomenological ambiguities surrounding mind blanking.\"\nIn the past, mind blanking has only been studied using research and experiments developed to study mind wandering -- a similar internal experience in which our thoughts \"flow seamlessly like a stream.\" The researchers argue that mind blanking is a distinct experience that involves feeling sleepier, more sluggish, and making more errors, and should be inspired by mind wandering research, but considered independently.\n\"We sought to better understand mind blanking by parsing through 80 relevant research articles -- including some of our own in which we recorded participants' brain activity when they were reporting that they were 'thinking of nothing,'\" explains author Athena Demertzi of GIGA Research at University of Liège, Belgium.\nTakeaways from their research include:\nMind blank frequency varies greatly between different people, but a person experiences the phenomenon about 5%-20% of the time on average.\nCommon experiences defined as \"mind blanking\" include lapses of attention, memory issues, and a cessation of inner speech, among others.\nMind blanks tend to happen toward the end of long, sustained attention tasks like exams and after sleep deprivation or intense physical exercise, but are also a typical waking state.\nChildren with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report mind blanking more frequently than neurotypical people.\nMind blanking is part of the clinical description of generalized anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It is also relevant to several other clinical conditions including strokes, seizures, traumatic brain injuries, and Kleine-Levin syndrome -- which causes people to sleep up to 20 hours per day.\nExperiments observing brain activity during rest using technologies including fMRI and electroencephalography show that there are specific neural signatures in the frontal, temporal, and visual networks of the brain before a mind blank.\nDuring mind blanks after sustained attention tasks, people's heart rates and pupil sizes decreased and their brains showed lower signal complexity -- a state typically observed in unconscious people. During the blank, they observed disruptions in sensory processing and slow, sleep-like EEG waves. The authors describe these states in which parts of a person's brain appear asleep as \"local sleep episodes.\"\nAn increase in neural activity in posterior cortical brain regions can also lead to mind blanking, as is the case when high-speed thinking leads to slower cognitive function.\nWhen people were prompted to actively \"empty their minds,\" researchers observed deactivations in the inferior frontal gyrus, Broca's area, supplementary motor cortex, and hippocampus.\nThe researchers speculate that the common factor between different forms of blanking may be related to changes in arousal levels, leading to a malfunction of key cognitive mechanisms such as memory, language, or attention.\nGiven that blanking experiences vary so greatly -- both in terms of people's subjective experiences and their neural activity -- the researchers propose a framework that describes mind blanking as a dynamic group of physiologically driven experiences mediated by arousal states, or a person's state of physiological \"vigilance.\" As they describe it, this means that when the brain is in a high- or low-arousal state, a mind blank is more likely to occur.\n\"The experience of a 'blank mind' is as intimate and direct as that of bearing thoughts,\" says author Jennifer Windt of Monash University in A",
    "summary": "ever found yourself suddenly thinking of... nothing? 🧠 new research sheds light on “mind blanking” — those moments when our minds go silent, whether from drowsiness, distraction, or just a total pause in consciousness. unlike mind wandering, mind blanking is its own unique brain state, often linked to feeling sleepy, sluggish, or making mistakes. it happens to everyone (about 5-20% of the time), especially during long tasks, after poor sleep, or intense exercise. studies show that during these blanks, brain activity slows, heart rate drops, and parts of the brain can even act like they’re asleep. mind blanking is also more frequent in people with adhd and is relevant to conditions like anxiety, brain injury, and certain sleep disorders. this research is helping neuroscientists better understand how shifts in arousal and brain networks create these mysterious pauses — and why sometimes, our minds just need a break. 💤\n\n#neuroscience #brainhealth #mindblanking #mentalhealth #consciousness"

However, our study shows that harriers have independently evolved several key adaptations for finding prey by sound,\" she says.\nThe research team focused on harriers -- a group of hawks found in North America, Australia, NZ, Europe, and parts of Africa and Asia -- because they show some unusual, owl-like hunting behaviours.\nSenior author and PhD supervisor Dr Andrew Iwaniuk, Associate Professor at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, says: \"Hawks tend to hunt primarily by sight. But unlike other hawks, harriers fly low over tall grass with their beak pointed to the ground.\n\"During this so-called 'quartering flight', they are not only looking for prey, they are also listening for it,\" he says.\nCo-author Aubrey Keirnan, a PhD student at Flinders University who is also co-supervised by Dr Iwaniuk and Associate Professor Weisbecker, says that simply by looking at the harrier, you can see similarities with owls.\n\"The Australian Spotted Harrier is a great example,\" she says. \"When you look at this species' face, you can see a distinctive disc-shaped face, which may improve their prey localisation just like owls.\"\nThe discovery matches older behavioural studies showing that harriers can locate sounds with similar accuracy to owls, but how they did this has been a mystery.\nUsing specimens from wildlife rehabilitators and museums in Australia and Canada, the team examined the anatomy of the skull and brain of harriers and other closely related hawk species such as the wedge-tailed eagle.\nThey found that, like owls, harriers have enlarged ear openings and two expanded brain regions that are essential for calculating where a sound is coming from.\n\"These auditory nuclei are found in the brainstem and compare the time at which sounds arrive at the left or right ear,\" says co-author Associate Professor in evolutionary biology Vera Weisbecker, from Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering.\n\"If a sound arrives at both ears at the same time, then the sound is coming from directly in front of an animal. If there is a delay, this indicates that the prey is more to the left or right,\" she says.\n\"By having these two brain regions expanded, harriers can make such computations more accurately than other hawks, allowing them to locate where a potential rat, mouse or other prey is hiding in the grass.\"\n\"Harriers have therefore evolved an auditory system similar to owls, enabling them to target sounds as accurately as owls in a remarkable example of convergent evolution of both brain and behaviour in animals separated by over 60 million years,\" adds first author Ms Citron.\nThe team is careful to point out that the auditory system of many owls is far more sophisticated than that of harriers. This explains the ability of some owl species, such as the barn owl, to hunt in complete darkness whereas hawks only hunt during the day.\n\"There are several other features that help owls with their keen hearing which we did not find in harriers. For example, some owl species have asymmetric ears that allow them to locate sound with greater acuity, and these owls also have several other enlarged brain regions that were not enlarged in harriers,\" says Ms Citron.\nThe team hopes their study results will encourage further research on bird anatomy to find out how a species perceives its surrounds.\n\"Anatomical studies like ours are a window into how a bird perceives the wo",

Called Lp-Convolution, this method improves the accuracy and efficiency of image recognition systems while reducing the computational burden of existing AI models.\nShare:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLinkedIN\nEmail\nFULL STORY\nA team of researchers from the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Yonsei University, and the Max Planck Institute have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) technique that brings machine vision closer to how the human brain processes images. Called Lp-Convolution, this method improves the accuracy and efficiency of image recognition systems while reducing the computational burden of existing AI models.\nBridging the Gap Between CNNs and the Human Brain\nThe human brain is remarkably efficient at identifying key details in complex scenes, an ability that traditional AI systems have struggled to replicate. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) -- the most widely used AI model for image recognition -- process images using small, square-shaped filters. While effective, this rigid approach limits their ability to capture broader patterns in fragmented data.\nMore recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown superior performance by analyzing entire images at once, but they require massive computational power and large datasets, making them impractical for many real-world applications.\nInspired by how the brain's visual cortex processes information selectively through circular, sparse connections, the research team sought a middle ground: Could a brain-like approach make CNNs both efficient and powerful?\nIntroducing Lp-Convolution: A Smarter Way to See\nTo answer this, the team developed Lp-Convolution, a novel method that uses a multivariate p-generalized normal distribution (MPND) to reshape CNN filters dynamically. Unlike traditional CNNs, which use fixed square filters, Lp-Convolution allows AI models to adapt their filter shapes -- stretching horizontally or vertically based on the task, much like how the human brain selectively focuses on relevant details.\nThis breakthrough solves a long-standing challenge in AI research, known as the large kernel problem. Simply increasing filter sizes in CNNs (e.g., using 7×7 or larger kernels) usually does not improve performance, despite adding more parameters. Lp-Convolution overcomes this limitation by introducing flexible, biologically inspired connectivity patterns.\nReal-World Performance: Stronger, Smarter, and More Robust AI\nIn tests on standard image classification datasets (CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet), Lp-Convolution significantly improved accuracy on both classic models like AlexNet and modern architectures like RepLKNet. The method also proved to be highly robust against corrupted data, a major challenge in real-world AI applications.\nMoreover, the researchers found that when the Lp-masks used in their method resembled a Gaussian distribution, the AI's internal processing patterns closely matched biological neural activity, as confirmed through comparisons with mouse brain data.\n\"We humans quickly spot what matters in a crowded scene,\" said Dr. C. Justin LEE, Director of the Center for Cognition and Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science. \"Our Lp-Convolution mimics this ability, allowing AI to flexibly focus on the most relevant parts of an image -- just like the brain does.\"\nImpact and Future Applications\nUnlike previous efforts that either relied on small, rigid filters or required resource-heavy transformers, Lp-Convolution offers a practical, efficient alternative. This innovation could revolutionize fields such as:\n- Autonomous driving, where AI must quickly detect obstacles in real time\n- Medical imaging, improving AI-based diagnoses by highlighting subtle details\n- Robotics, enabling smarter and more adaptable machine vision under changing conditions\n\"This work is a powerful contribution to both AI and neuroscience,\" said Director C. Justin Lee. \"By aligning AI more closely with the brain, we've unlocked new potential for CNNs, making them smarter, more adaptable, and more biologically realistic.\"\nLooking ahead, the team plans to refine this technology further, exploring its applications in complex reasoning tasks such as puzzle-solving (e.g., Sudoku) and real-time image processing.\nThe study will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025, and the research team has made their code and models publicly available:\nFurther information:\nhttps://github.com/jeakwon/lpconv/\n.\nRELATED TOPICS\nMind & Brain\nIntelligence\nBrain-Computer Interfaces\nPerception\nBrain Injury\nComputers & Math\nNeura",

Controlling the concentration of different ions can provide important insights into how individual braincells are affected, and how cells work together. The pipette could also be used for treatments. Their study has been published in the journal Small.\n\"In the long term, this technology could be used to treat neurological diseases such as epilepsy with extremely high precision,\" says Daniel Simon, professor at Linköping University, LiU.\nThe human brain consists of about 85 to 100 billion neurons. It also has roughly the same amount of brain cells that support neuron function with, for example, nutrition, oxygen and healing. These cells are called glial cells and can be divided into many subgroups. Between the cells there is a fluid-filled space called the extracellular milieu.\nThe difference between the milieu inside the cells and that outside is important for cell function and one important aspect is the transport of different types of ions between the two milieus. For example, neurons are activated when the concentration of potassium ions changes.\nIt is known that a change in the whole extracellular milieu affects neuron activity and thereby brain activity. However, it has so far not been known how local changes in ion concentration affect individual neurons and glial cells.\nPrevious attempts to change the extracellular milieu have primarily involved pumping in some form of liquid. But this means that the delicate biochemical balance is disturbed, making it difficult to know whether it is the substances in the fluid, the changed pressure or the extracellular fluid swirling around that leads to the activity.\nTo get around the problem, researchers at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics, LOE, at LiU developed a micropipette measuring only 2 micrometres in diameter. For comparison, human hair measures 50 and a neuron about 10 micrometres in diameter.\nUsing this so-called iontonic micropipette, the researchers can add only ions, such as potassium and sodium, to the extracellular milieu to see how this affects the neurons. Glial cell, specifically astrocyte, activity is also measured.\n\"Glial cells are the cells that make up the other -- chemical -- half of the brain, which we don't know much about because there has been no way to precisely activate those cells, as they don't respond to electrical stimulation. But both neurons and glial cells can be stimulated chemically,\" says Theresia Arbring Sjöström, assistant professor at LOE.\nThe experiments were conducted on slices of hippocampus brain tissue from mice.\n\"The neurons didn't respond as quickly to the change in ion concentration as we had initially expected. However, the astrocytes responded directly and very dynamically. Only when these were \"saturated\" were the nerve cells activated. This highlighted the fine-tuned dynamics between different types of cells in the brain in a way that other technologies haven't managed to do,\" says Theresia Arbring Sjöström.\nSomewhat simplified, you can say that the pipette is manufactured by heating up a glass tube and pulling it to the breaking point. This produces a very thin and tapered tip. This type of micropipette is usually used in neuroscience to create and measure electrical activity in the brain. The LiU researchers' iontronic micropipette has a tip filled with a specially adapted ion-exchange membrane, which makes it possible to create activity by chemical means. Other than that, it looks identical to the traditional micropipette, and is controlled in a similar way.\n\"The advantage is that tens of thousands of people around the world are familiar with this tool and know how to handle it. Hopefully this will make it useful sooner,\" says Daniel Simon.\nThe next step is to continue studying chemical signalling in both healthy and diseased brain tissue using the micropipette. The researchers also want to develop the delivery of medical drugs and study its effect against neurological diseases such as epilepsy.\nRELATED TOPICS\nHealth & Medicine\nNervous System\nBrain Tumor\nStem Cells\nMind & Brain\nNeuroscience\nBrain Injury\nDisorders and Synd",
    "summary": "a groundbreaking new micropipette developed by researchers at linköping university lets scientists deliver ions directly to individual neurons, without disturbing the delicate environment around brain cells. this innovation allows for pinpoint control over how neurons and glial cells, like astrocytes, interact—revealing new details about brain cell communication that were previously impossible to study. by targeting specific cells with chemical signals, rather than electrical ones, this tool opens doors to understanding the brain’s complex chemistry and could lead to ultra-precise treatments for neurological conditions like epilepsy. because the pipette is similar to those already used in labs worldwide, it has the potential to be adopted quickly, accelerating new discoveries in neuroscience. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #brainresearch #innovation #neurotech #scienceupdate"

But because the relationship between insomnia and heavy drinking goes in both directions, the influence of stress or depression depends on which condition came first, the analysis found.\n\"We were most interested in how insomnia leads to drinking, and we found that seems to occur primarily through stress. But when we switched pathways, it appeared that drinking primarily led to insomnia through depression,\" said Jessica Weafer, senior author of the study and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health in The Ohio State University College of Medicine.\n\"Identifying these types of mediating factors can have important treatment implications,\" she said. \"If people who have insomnia are experiencing a lot of stress, then if we can target the stress, that might reduce the likelihood that their insomnia would lead to heavy drinking. That's the long-term ideal, or hope, that this work could have an impact on treatment.\"\nThe study was published recently in the journal\nAlcohol\n.\nInsomnia and hazardous drinking can cause upheaval in one's life: Both are associated with missed work and lower productivity on the job. Chronic insomnia can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and other chronic illnesses. A defining characteristic of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is continuing to drink even when encountering interpersonal problems, getting sick or hurt, or driving while intoxicated.\nWeafer has expanded her research focus on risks for problem drinking to address the fact that poor sleep can lead to increased drinking and those with AUD commonly have difficulty with sleep.\n\"The number of people with AUD who also have insomnia is very, very high. It's striking, and important,\" she said.\nParticipants in this study were part of a larger project testing the effectiveness of a digital insomnia intervention for people with poor sleep who are heavy drinkers. A total of 405 volunteers completed questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, current and historic drinking behaviors, perceived stress and depression symptoms.\nStress and depression often overlap, but are distinct -- the stress scale measures the degree to which situations in life are perceived as stressful, and the depression scale measures behaviors and feelings related to hope, fear, happiness and loneliness.\nPrevious research has suggested that stress or depression, or both, contribute to troubled sleep or heavy drinking, said first study author Justin Verlinden, a cognitive neuroscience PhD student at the University of Kentucky.\n\"There are so many different pathways that could explain insomnia and alcohol use. We wanted to connect the dots and see if there's anything there,\" he said.\nAnalyzing the data with a range of statistical models revealed the many ways stress and depression influence the relationship between insomnia and hazardous drinking.\n\"If you look at stress and depression separately, we find there is an indirect relationship between insomnia and drinking as well as drinking and insomnia -- meaning a good chunk of the relationship between insomnia and drinking can be explained through perceived stress or depression,\" Verlinden said.\n\"When you put both stress and depression in the same models, that's where we get unique findings, even though there are a lot of shared characteristics between stress and depression.\"\nA model of insomnia predicting heavy use of alcohol showed that the characteristics of stress -- beyond any symptoms shared with depression -- better described this relationship. In a model reversing the order, where drinking predicts the onset of insomnia, symptoms of depression that aren't shared with stress better explain the link.\n\"That finding was very surprising, but showed the benefit of looking at both stress and depression in the same model, to see how those pathways might differ depending on what the directionality is,\" Weafer said.\nBoth stress and depression are described as partial indi",
    "summary": "new research highlights how stress and depression play key roles in the link between insomnia and heavy drinking. interestingly, the impact of stress or depression depends on which comes first—if insomnia starts the cycle, stress is the main driver toward hazardous drinking. but when heavy drinking comes first, depression is the stronger link to later sleep problems. these findings are especially relevant in neuroscience, as they reveal how mental health factors like stress and depression can shape brain pathways connecting sleep and substance use. understanding these connections could lead to better, more targeted treatments for those struggling with both sleep and drinking issues. prioritizing mental health and healthy sleep habits might be the key to breaking this cycle. 🧠🍃\n\n#neuroscience #mentalhealth #sleep #alcohol #stress #depression #research #healthyliving"

Navigating this lively jumble of words -- and focusing on the ones that matter -- is particularly difficult for people with some form of hearing loss. Bustling conversations can become a fused mess of chatter, even if someone has hearing aids, which often struggle filtering out background noise. It's known as the \"cocktail party problem\" -- and Boston University researchers believe they might have a solution.\nA new brain-inspired algorithm developed at BU could help hearing aids tune out interference and isolate single talkers in a crowd of voices. In testing, researchers found it could improve word recognition accuracy by 40 percentage points relative to current hearing aid algorithms.\n\"We were extremely surprised and excited by the magnitude of the improvement in performance -- it's pretty rare to find such big improvements,\" says Kamal Sen, the algorithm's developer and a BU College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering. The findings were published in\nCommunications Engineering\n, a Nature Portfolio journal.\nSome estimates put the number of Americans with hearing loss at close to50 million; by 2050, around 2.5 billion people globally are expected to have some form of hearing loss, according to theWorld Health Organization.\n\"The primary complaint of people with hearing loss is that they have trouble communicating in noisy environments,\" saysVirginia Best, a BU Sargent College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences research associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences. \"These environments are very common in daily life and they tend to be really important to people -- think about dinner table conversations, social gatherings, workplace meetings. So, solutions that can enhance communication in noisy places have the potential for a huge impact.\"\nBest was a coauthor on the study with Sen and BU biomedical engineering PhD candidate Alexander D. Boyd (ENG'23,'26). As part of the research, they also tested the ability of current hearing aid algorithms to cope with the cacophony of cocktail parties. Many hearing aids already include noise reduction algorithms and directional microphones, or beamformers, designed to emphasize sounds coming from the front.\n\"We decided to benchmark against the industry standard algorithm that's currently in hearing aids,\" says Sen. That existing algorithm \"doesn't improve performance at all; if anything, it makes it slightly worse. Now we have data showing what's been known anecdotally from people with hearing aids.\"\nSen has patented the new algorithm -- known as BOSSA, which stands for biologically oriented sound segregation algorithm -- and is hoping to connect with companies interested in licensing the technology. He says that with Apple jumping into the hearing aid market -- its latest AirPod Pro 2 headphones are advertised as having a clinical-grade hearing aid function -- the BU team's breakthrough is timely: \"If hearing aid companies don't start innovating fast, they're going to get wiped out, because Apple and other start-ups are entering the market.\"\nSuccessfully Segregating Sounds\nFor the past 20 years, Sen has been studying how the brain encodes and decodes sounds, looking for the circuits involved in managing the cocktail party effect. With researchers in his Natural Sounds & Neural Coding Laboratory, he's plotted how sound waves are processed at different stages of the auditory pathway, tracking their journey from the ear to translation by the brain. One key mechanism: inhibitory neurons, brain cells that help suppress certain, unwanted sounds.\n\"You can think of it as a form of internal noise cancellation,\" he says. \"If there's a sound at a particular location, these inhibitory neurons get activated.\" According to Sen, different neurons are tuned to different locations and frequencies.\nThe brain's approach is the inspiration for the new algorithm, which uses spatial cues like the volume and timing of a sound to tune into or tune out of it, sharpening or muffling a speaker's words as needed.\n\"It's basically a computational model that mimics wh",

The study, published Feb. 25 in\nNature Communications\n, challenges the conventional belief that a type of fat called ceramides accumulates in blood vessels causing inflammation and health risks. Instead, their findings reveal that when ceramides decrease in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, it can be damaging and cause chronic illnesses. Ironically, the findings could ultimately lead to therapies that maintain high levels of these protective lipids in patients with obesity.\nCeramides are found throughout the body and in the endothelium, the thin lining inside blood vessels. These waxy lipids regulate blood vessel tone, dilating or contracting vessels to modulate blood pressure. They also help prevent blood clots, keeping blood flowing easily through the body's extensive highway of arteries and veins.\n\"The common assumption in the field was that high levels of ceramides in the endothelium of blood vessels contributed to cardiovascular disease, but this conclusion was extrapolated from in vitro data in cells,\" said Dr. Annarita Di Lorenzo, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. \"Ours is the first in vivo study that measures the levels of the lipids in the endothelial cells of an animal model. In obese mice fed a high-fat diet, ceramides do not build up -- they decrease compared to lean mice.\" Also working on this research are co-first authors Dr. Onorina L. Manzo, postdoctoral associate and Luisa Rubinelli, both in Dr. Di Lorenzo's lab.\nCeramide to the Rescue\nDr. Di Lorenzo and her team discovered the importance of ceramides in blood vessels two years ago. Together with Dr. Giuseppe Faraco, assistant professor of neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine, they found that decreased levels of ceramides in otherwise healthy mice causes severe blood vessel inflammation in the brain, clot formation and death. Last year, the team reported that ceramide production increases as a protective response in a mouse model of coronary artery disease. Ultimately, when ceramide is broken down by the body it produces a compound called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which builds up and protects mice against cardiovascular disease. But when this process doesn't work the mice are left vulnerable.\nThe researchers also found that two proteins, Nogo-B and ORMDL, decreased the production of ceramides and S1P in obesity. This decrease leads to increased blood pressure, impaired vascular regulation and higher glucose levels -- all of which contribute to cardiometabolic conditions that affect the heart (cardiovascular system) and energy processing (metabolism), like diabetes like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke.\nMaintaining Balance\nTo understand how these different molecules interact, the researchers tested what happens in animal models. Mice with obesity fed a high-fat diet had low levels of ceramides and S1P, but high levels of Nogo-B. These mice showed signs of inflammation, diabetes and high blood pressure.\nBut what happens if the Nogo-B inhibitor wasn't present? The researchers knocked out Nogo-B only in the endothelium of blood vessels in a mouse model to find out. \"These mice have the same body weight and diabetes as controls, but their blood vessel health is much better,\" said Dr. Di Lorenzo. \"By knocking out this inhibitor, we preserved vascular health. This also showed that the regulation of ceramide metabolism causes vascular dysfunction and inflammation in obesity.\"\nThe paper suggests that targeting this metabolic pathway could have multiple beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases related to obesity. \"Nogo suppresses biosynthesis of ceramides, so if we can identify a drug that can block Nogo-B, we could restore ceramide levels to a healthy balance and this would fight not only obesity and diabetes, but would directly keep blood vessels func",
    "summary": "groundbreaking new research reveals that, contrary to old beliefs, it’s not the buildup but the *loss* of certain fats—specifically ceramides—in blood vessel linings that raises the risk of heart disease in obesity and diabetes 🧬. these protective lipids help regulate blood pressure and prevent clots, but when their levels drop, inflammation and vascular issues rise. the study also connects low ceramides to brain blood vessel inflammation, highlighting a vital link to neuroscience. by targeting proteins that suppress ceramide production, future therapies might restore balance, improving both heart and brain health in those with obesity. \n\n#neuroscience #hearthealth #obesity #lipids #research #wellness"

The action came in response to the\nrejection\nof White House demands for changes that the University argues infringes on its independence and constitutional rights and exceeds the administration’s lawful authority.\nThe\nNIH had earlier halted\nan estimated $110 million in grants to Harvard and its associated hospitals since late February.\nWe interviewed some of the researchers whose projects have been halted or face an uncertain future.\nSarah Fortune\nJohn LaPorte Given Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, and chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\nResearch interrupted:\nA $60 million seven-year, multi-institutional consortium to study how the immune system controls tuberculosis.\n“About a third of the world is thought to be infected with TB and carry TB, and most of those people will not get sick. But every year, 10 million people get sick, and 1 million people die, which makes TB the world’s leading infectious cause of death. We’re trying to understand the difference between protective and failed immunity to TB to better identify people with TB and then prevent TB, ideally with an effective vaccine.\n“This consortium was conceived of at the National Institutes of Health as their moonshot effort to move the needle on TB. The goal was to bring together the very best researchers from around the country and around the world to bring the very best cutting-edge technology, the very best science to understand TB immunity. And if it stops, the whole thing is gone.\n“I’ve been building this consortium since about 2014. For me, this is over a decade of work. Scientific knowledge, scientific expertise is a craft. And if you blow it up, you can’t just rehire people and recreate it and then start again. It’s gone.”\n[Open Philanthropy, a California-based philanthropic group, has authorized a $500,000 grant to allow researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to complete an ongoing tuberculosis vaccine study,\nThe Boston Globe\nreported Monday.

We have made great progress on this project.\n“The BARDA project supported by NASA is to use human organ-on-a-chip technology to create living ‘avatars’ of astronauts by lining the chips with cells from astronauts and then flying the chips alongside them on space missions. The goal is to use these to understand the effects of microgravity and radiation (which currently makes it impossible for man to go on long space flights, to Mars, for example) and again, develop countermeasures. This initial project is to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.\n“Radiation countermeasure drugs we are developing would be valuable for cancer patients, many of whom receive radiation therapy and experience side effects (higher and more effective therapeutic doses could be administered with less toxicity) as well as be stockpiled to protect against a nuclear disaster or attack; and they could enable long term spaceflight, and hence, exploration of Mars, which is not possible now.\n“As for what the repercussions are, it means that this type of work would stop but more importantly that the salaries of almost 20 students, fellows, and staff are at risk if this stop order is not reversed soon.”\nDuane Wesemann\nAssociate professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School\nResearch in peril:\nA $10 million project grant to fund a large consortium of laboratories to study the immune system and its ability to respond to different ",

Analysis of 740 manuscripts and 1,490 reviews revealed that 81.4% of authors opted to share rebuttal letters, with increasing participation over time (67.6% in Dec 2023 to 94.4% in Aug 2024). Reviewer participation was lower (66.8%) but stable, with higher opt-in rates for longer, higher-quality reviews. Geographical analysis of author and reviewer institutions showed that authors from North American and European institutions had greater OPR opt-in rates, authors from Asian institutions had lower opt-in rates, and reviewers from North American institutions had lower opt-in rates compared with the average rates across regions. Further, analysis of manuscript subdiscipline showed it to be predictive of OPR opt-in rates, e.g., authors of manuscripts in cellular or molecular neuroscience were less likely to opt-in compared with the average across subdisciplines.

It plays a central role when students attempt to solve math word problems. For the study, researchers worked with 207 third grade students with and without math difficulties to see how working memory influenced their abilities to solve word problems.\n\"In problem-solving, working memory serves as the mental chalkboard where we temporarily hold and manipulate the information needed to find a solution,\" said Michael Orosco, associate professor of educational psychology in KU's School of Education & Human Sciences and one of the study's authors. \"We are investigating whether working memory serves as a mediator and moderator in mathematical problem-solving outcomes, comparable to its role in other cognitive processes.\"\nStudents in the sample were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions in which they used different approaches to solving word problems:\nA verbal emphasis strategy that taught students to underline questions, circle numbers or cross out irrelevant information;\nA visual emphasis strategy that taught students to use diagrams representing part-whole relationships and quantity comparisons;\nA verbal and visual strategy, which combined elements of the first two;\nA materials-only strategy, which used the same materials but without overt motor activities such as underlining or diagramming.\nStudents took part in an eight-week intervention using the assigned conditions and were tested before and after on their working memory and word problem-solving ability. Results showed that working memory predicted post-test problem solving ability and that the strategies reduced strain on working memory as they gained experience.\n\"We found that by using these conditions, you could improve the students' word problem-solving by improving working memory,\" Orosco said. \"They helped reduce cognitive load, or basically free up space in the working memory to learn more information while working to solve problems.\"\nThe study, co-written with H. Lee Swanson of the University of California-Riverside and Deborah Reed of the University of Tennessee, was published in the journal Child Neuropsychology.\nResults from post-tests also confirmed the importance of working memory. Students with higher working memory consistently also had higher scores in word problem-solving. Strategies that included overt cues such as underlining key information or crossing out irrelevant sentences decreased demands on working memory and those that progressively increased complexity of problems improved working memory in students with math difficulty. However, despite the benefits of the interventions, students without math difficulty consistently outperformed those with math difficulty.\nFuture research could further explore executive functions such as working memory in word problem-solving and the role artificial intelligence could play in understanding the functions as well as developing interventions, said Orosco, who leads a graduate certificate program in mind, brain and education at KU.\nOrosco said the study both adds to the literature on the importance of working memory and builds on the growing body of knowledge in the science of math. In both cases, the research can help improve instruction for both students who do and do not struggle with math. There will always be students who do not respond to general instruction, and giving teachers better tools to help them is showing to have benefits for all students, he added.\n\"If there is one area our teachers often don't initially get, it's educational neuroscience, because they just don't get training in i",
    "summary": "new research highlights how boosting working memory—the brain’s “mental chalkboard”—can help students, especially those with math difficulties, become better at solving word problems. 🧠✏️ by using targeted strategies like underlining key info or drawing diagrams, students were able to reduce cognitive load and free up mental space for learning. this study underscores the crucial link between working memory and math performance, showing that interventions can help all students, not just those who struggle. as neuroscience and education come together, these findings offer fresh ways for teachers to support diverse learners and strengthen math skills in the classroom. #neuroscience #education #workingmemory #mathskills #edresearch"

The model identifies patients at high risk for delirium and alerts a specially-trained team to assess the patient and create a treatment plan, if needed.\nThe model, developed by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has been integrated into hospital operations, helping health care providers identify and manage delirium, a condition that can affect up to one-third of hospitalized patients.\nThe study, the first to show that an AI-powered delirium risk assignment model can not only perform well in a laboratory setting but also deliver real-world benefits in clinical practice, was published in the May 7, 2025 online issue of\nJAMA Network Open .\nDelirium is a sudden and severe state of confusion that carries life-threatening risks and often goes undetected in hospitalized patients. Without treatment, it can prolong hospital stays, raise mortality risk, and worsen long-term outcomes. Until now, AI-driven delirium prediction models have struggled to demonstrate tangible improvements in patient care, say the investigators.\n\"The motivation behind our study at Mount Sinai was clear. Current AI-based delirium prediction models haven't yet shown real-world benefits for patient care,\" said senior corresponding study author Joseph Friedman, MD, Founder and Director of Delirium Services for the Mount Sinai Health System and Professor of Psychiatry, and Neuroscience, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"We wanted to change that by creating a model that accurately calculates delirium risk in real time and integrates smoothly into clinical workflows, helping hospital staff catch and treat more patients with delirium who might otherwise be overlooked.\"\nRather than building an AI model in isolation and testing it later in hospitals, the research team worked closely with Mount Sinai clinicians and hospital staff from the start. This \"vertical integration\" approach allowed them to refine the model in real time, ensuring it was both effective and practical for clinical use.\nWhen deployed at Mount Sinai, the AI model dramatically improved delirium detection, resulting in:\n• A 400 percent increase in identified cases without increasing time spent screening patients\n• Safer prescribing by reducing the use of potentially inappropriate medications in older adults\n• Strong, reliable performance in a real-world hospital setting\nIn their study, which involved more than 32,000 patients admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, the researchers used the AI model to analyze a combination of structured data and clinicians' notes from electronic health records. It used machine learning to identify chart data patterns associated with a high risk of delirium and applied natural language processing to identify patterns from the language of chart notes written by hospital staff. This approach captures staff observations of subtle mental status changes in patients who are delirious or at heightened risk. An individual staff member writing a note may be unaware at that time that their clinical observations are helping to improve the AI model's accuracy.\nNotably, the model was tested in a highly diverse patient population with a wide range of medical and surgical conditions -- far broader than the narrow groups typically included in studies of machine learning-based delirium risk prediction models.\nThe tool significantly improved monthly delirium detection rates -- from 4.4 to 17.2 percent -- allowing for earlier intervention. Patients identified also received lower doses of sedative medications, potentially reducing side effects and improving overall care.\n\"Our model isn't about replacing doctors -- it's about giving them a powerful tool to streamline their work,\" says Dr. Friedman. \"By doing the heavy lifting of analyzing vast amounts of patient data, our machine learning approach allows health care providers to focus their expertise on diagnosing and treating patients more effectively and with greater precision.\"\nWhile the AI model has delivered strong results at The Mount Sinai Hospit",
    "summary": "a new ai model is transforming hospital care by helping doctors spot delirium—a dangerous, often-missed state of confusion—in patients much earlier. by analyzing both health records and staff notes, the tool alerts a specialized team when someone’s at risk, leading to faster treatment and safer medication choices. this approach quadrupled detection rates without adding work for hospital staff, and it’s already improving outcomes in a diverse patient group. this breakthrough shows how ai can be seamlessly woven into real-world clinical practice, making a big impact on patient safety and brain health. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #aiinhealthcare #hospitalinnovation #delirium #patientcare"

The TRP ion channels TRPV1 and TRPM2 have been implicated in warmth detection, yet their precise roles remain unclear. A key challenge is the low prevalence of warmth-sensitive sensory neurons, comprising fewer than 10% of rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Using calcium imaging of >20,000 cultured mouse DRG neurons, we uncovered distinct contributions of TRPV1 and TRPM2 to warmth sensitivity. TRPV1’s absence – and to a lesser extent absence of TRPM2 – reduces the number of neurons responding to warmth. Additionally, TRPV1 mediates the rapid, dynamic response to a warmth challenge. Behavioural tracking in a whole-body thermal preference assay revealed that these cellular differences shape nuanced thermal behaviours. Drift diffusion modelling of decision-making in mice exposed to varying temperatures showed that TRPV1 deletion impairs evidence accumulation, reducing the precision of thermal choice, while TRPM2 deletion increases overall preference for warmer environments that wildtype mice avoid. It remains unclear whether TRPM2 in DRG sensory neurons or elsewhere mediates thermal preference. Our findings suggest that different aspects of thermal information, such as stimulation speed and temperature magnitude, are encoded by distinct TRP channel mechanisms.\nThe detection of temperature and the related behavioural responses are an integral part of our sensory interaction with the outside world. Thus, it is not surprising that temperature detection was one of the first sensory modalities to be studied in contemporary neuroscience (\nZotterman, 1936\n). Early studies concentrated on the characterization of temperature-specific sensory fibres, covering the range from noxious cold, through innocuous cold and warm, to noxious heat (\nHensel and Schafer, 1984\n). However, the molecular mechanism by which temperature activates these fibres remained elusive for decades.\nA major breakthrough in the field of somatosensory research was the identification of temperature-sensitive ion channels that belong to the transient-receptor potential (TRP) super family as the molecular sensors responsible for the detection of noxious cold and heat in sensory neurons (\nCaterina et al., 1997\n;\nPeier et al., 2002\n;\nMcKemy et al., 2002\n). However, the detection of temperatures in-between noxious cold and heat (25– 43°C), which are often perceived as non-painful, is incompletely understood. This innocuous temperature range also contains the so-called thermoneutral point (TNP), an ambient temperature (29–33°C) at which mice do not exert additional energy to maintain their body temperature (\nŠkop et al., 2020\n). This makes the innocuous temperature range crucial for thermoregulation and the animal’s subsequent thermal or comfort choice. Recent studies began to uncover the mechanisms behind innocuous warm-temperature detection, thereby mainly converging on three candidate cation channels, namely TRPV1, TRPM2, and TRPM8 (\nYarmoli",
    "summary": "new research reveals that the trpv1 and trpm2 ion channels play distinct roles in how we sense and respond to warm temperatures. using advanced neuron imaging and behavioral tests in mice, scientists found that trpv1 is essential for quickly detecting warmth and making precise thermal decisions, while trpm2 influences warmth avoidance behaviors. this work is especially relevant as neuroscience continues to unravel how our bodies interpret subtle temperature changes—key for understanding comfort, thermoregulation, and even pain. the findings highlight the complexity of our sensory systems and open new paths for exploring how the brain and body process temperature. 🌡️🧠\n\n#neuroscience #sensoryscience #trpchannels #temperaturedetection #researchupdate"

On average the little patients experienced significant improvements in several post-operative outcomes, including quicker recovery and reduced incidence of delirium.\n\"I think the main takeaway is that in kids, using the EEG, we can reduce the amount of anesthesia we give them and maintain the same level of unconsciousness,\" said study co-author Emery N. Brown, Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at MIT and an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. The study appeared April 21 in\nJAMA Pediatrics\n.\nYasuko Nagasaka, chair of anesthesiology at Tokyo Women's Medical University, a former colleague of Brown's in the United States, designed the study. She asked Brown to train and advise lead author Kiyoyuki Miyasaka of St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo on how to use EEG to monitor unconsciousness and adjust anesthesia dosing in children. Miyasaka then served as the anesthesiologist for all patients in the trial. Attending anesthesiologists not involved in the study were always on hand to supervise.\nBrown's research has shown that a person's level of consciousness under any particular anesthetic drug is discernible from patterns of their brain waves. Each child's brain waves were measured with EEG, but in the control group Miyasaka adhered to standard anesthesia dosing protocols while in the experimental group he used the EEG measures as a guide for dosing. The results show that when he used EEG, he was able to induce the desired level of unconsciousness with a concentration of 2 percent sevoflurane gas, rather than the standard 5 percent. Maintenance of unconsciousness, meanwhile, only turned out to require 0.9 percent concentration, rather than the standard 2.5 percent.\nMeanwhile, a separate researcher, blinded to whether EEG or standard protocols were used, assessed the kids for \"pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium\" (PAED), in which children sometimes wake up from anesthesia with a set of side effects including lack of eye contact, inconsolability, unawareness of surroundings, restlessness and non-purposeful movements. Children who received standard anesthesia dosing met the threshold for PAED in 35 percent of cases (30 out of 86), while children who received EEG-guided dosing met the threshold in 21 percent of cases (19 out of 91). The difference of 14 percentage points was statistically significant.\nMeanwhile, the authors reported that on average EEG-guided patients had breathing tubes removed 3.3 minutes earlier, emerged from anesthesia 21.4 minutes earlier, and were discharged from post-acute care 16.5 minutes earlier than patients who received anesthesia according to the standard protocol. All of these differences were statistically significant. Also, no child in the study ever became aware during surgery.\nThe authors noted that the quicker recovery among patients who received EEG-guided anesthesia was not only better medically, but also reduced healthcare costs. Time in post-acute care in the U.S. costs about $46 a minute so the average reduced time of 16.5 minutes would save about $750 per case. Sevoflurane is also a potent greenhouse gas, Brown noted, so reducing its use is better for the environment.\nIn the study the authors also present comparisons of the EEG recordings from children in the control and experimental groups. There are notable differences in the \"spectrograms\" that charted the power of individual brain wave frequencies both as children were undergoing surgery and while they were approaching emergence from anesthesia, Brown said.\nFor instance, among children who received EEG-guided dosing, there are well defined bands of high power at about 1-3 Hertz and 10-12 Hz. In children who received standard protocol dosing, the entire range of frequencies up to about 15 Hz are at high power. In another example, children who experienced PAED showed higher power at several frequencies up to 30Hz than children who did not experience PAED.\nThe findings further validate the idea that monitoring brain waves during surgery can provide anesthesiologists with actionable guidance to improve ",
    "summary": "new research shows that monitoring kids' brain waves (EEG) during surgery allows anesthesiologists to safely use much less anesthesia, leading to faster recovery and fewer side effects like delirium. by tailoring doses to each child's brain activity, doctors reduced anesthesia use without compromising safety, helping kids wake up quicker and feel better sooner. this approach also means lower healthcare costs and reduces the environmental impact of anesthesia gases. as neuroscience advances, using real-time brain monitoring is proving to be a game-changer for safer, smarter care in the operating room. 🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #anesthesia #pediatrics #brainscience #medicalinnovation"

However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying behavioral changes induced by avatar interactions remain poorly understood, particularly when avatars serve as communication partners. To address this gap and uncover the biological mechanisms involved, we conducted behavioral (\nn\n= 28) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (\nn\n= 51) experiments using a simple gambling task. Participants received dynamic facial-expression feedback from either a human observer presented as an avatar or a real human face based on the outcome (win or no-win) of each gambling trial. Our results showed that expecting avatar feedback significantly increased gambling behavior in both behavioral and fMRI settings. Computational modeling revealed that differences in risk-taking behavior between the avatar and human conditions were associated with differential valuation of feedback uncertainty. Furthermore, we found that the amygdala encodes the differential valuation of feedback uncertainty, where a negative response to feedback uncertainty played a key role in choosing a gambling option. Additionally, we found that individual differences in behavioral and neural valuation of feedback uncertainty correlate with the questionnaire score that measures emotional consideration of another person’s internal states. These results demonstrate the facilitation of risk-taking behavior by avatar feedback and its underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms, thus providing deeper biological insights into risk-taking behavior and implications for human social interactions using avatars.\nCitation:\nTanaka T, Haruno M (2025) Feedback from an avatar facilitates risk-taking by modulating the amygdala response to feedback uncertainty.

In virtual-reality (VR) environments, individuals can adopt various forms of avatars, projecting their behaviors into a virtual realm where their interaction partners also appear as avatars. With this shift in communication style, it is essential to understand how the use of avatars influences our behavior and brain functions.\nThe behavioral effects of using avatars for oneself have been extensively investigated. A key example is the Proteus effect, in which an individual’s behavior in VR is shaped by the characteristics of their avatar [\n1\n,\n2\n]. Prior research has shown that using an Einstein-like avatar can enhance task accuracy requiring inspiration [\n3\n],",
    "summary": "new research reveals that receiving feedback from avatars, rather than real human faces, encourages people to take more risks during decision-making tasks 🧠🎲. this effect is linked to how the amygdala processes uncertainty—avatar feedback changes our brain’s valuation of uncertain outcomes, nudging us toward riskier choices. these findings are especially relevant as virtual interactions and avatar-based communication become more common in our digital world. understanding how avatars influence our emotions and decisions can offer fresh insights into online behavior, social connection, and even mental health in the age of the metaverse.\n\n#neuroscience #virtualreality #avatarpsychology #socialbrain #riskandreward"

One new type of AI model, called \"state-space models,\" has been designed specifically to understand these sequential patterns more effectively. However, existing state-space models often face challenges — they can become unstable or require a significant amount of computational resources when processing long data sequences.\nTo address these issues, CSAIL researchers T. Konstantin Rusch and Daniela Rus have developed what they call “linear oscillatory state-space models” (LinOSS), which leverage principles of forced harmonic oscillators — a concept deeply rooted in physics and observed in biological neural networks. This approach provides stable, expressive, and computationally efficient predictions without overly restrictive conditions on the model parameters.\n\"Our goal was to capture the stability and efficiency seen in biological neural systems and translate these principles into a machine learning framework,\" explains Rusch. \"With LinOSS, we can now reliably learn long-range interactions, even in sequences spanning hundreds of thousands of data points or more.\"\nThe LinOSS model is unique in ensuring stable prediction by requiring far less restrictive design choices than previous methods. Moreover, the researchers rigorously proved the model’s universal approximation capability, meaning it can approximate any continuous, causal function relating input and output sequences.\nEmpirical testing demonstrated that LinOSS consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models across various demanding sequence classification and forecasting tasks. Notably, LinOSS outperformed the widely-used Mamba model by nearly two times in tasks involving sequences of extreme length.\nRecognized for its significance, the research was selected for an oral presentation at ICLR 2025 — an honor awarded to only the top 1 percent of submissions. The MIT researchers anticipate that the LinOSS model could significantly impact any fields that would benefit from accurate and efficient long-horizon forecasting and classification, including health-care analytics, climate science, autonomous driving, and financial forecasting.\n\"This work exemplifies how mathematical rigor can lead to performance breakthroughs and broad applications,\" Rus says. \"With LinOSS, we’re providing the scientific community with a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex systems, bridging the gap between biological inspiration and computational innovation.\"\nThe team imagines that the emergence of a new paradigm like LinOSS will be of interest to machine learning practitioners to build upon. Looking ahead, the researchers plan to apply their model to an even wider range of different data modalities. Moreover, they suggest that LinOSS could",

If you want to avoid a ticket, this is not a simple cognitive task. You will need to remember information splayed across street signs you have now long driven by: which side of the street are you allowed to park on? At what times? On which days?\nInformation that we cannot see anymore can be stored for seconds in our working memory (\nRepovs and Baddeley, 2006\n). Rather than being a simple ‘mental sketchpad’ of past events, however, working memory guides our future behavior and actions (\nvan Ede and Nobre, 2023\n). Exactly how and where this takes place remain fundamental questions of cognitive neuroscience. In fact, seemingly contradictory theories and evidence exist on the various neural circuits that can participate in this process.\nFor one, visual areas that process ongoing sensory signals at the back of the brain can be ‘recruited’ to hold recent information in working memory (\nD’Esposito and Postle, 2015\n;\nSerences, 2016\n). Yet, under some circumstances, specific working memories are detectable in the frontal cortex, a region at the opposite side of the brain that is involved in high-level cognitive processes (\nChristophel et al., 2017\n;\nEster et al., 2015\n).\nThe brain areas and mechanisms that are recruited to support working memory likely differ based on the type of information that needs to be remembered, and what it will be used for. In laboratory settings, the choice of experimental design – such as the brain recording method, training or task timing – is also likely to have an impact. Now, in eLife, Zhujun Shao, Mengya Zhang and Qing Yu (from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing) report that the human frontal cortex flexibly adapts its role for working memory storage depending on the task at hand (\nShao et al., 2025\n).\nTo test this idea, Shao et al. designed a complex working memory experiment in which goals, rules and cognitive demands changed quickly between trials (\nFigure 1\n). It relied on stimuli consisting of simple lines slanted at different, pre-established angles. In ‘maintenance’ trials, participants were asked which of two lines matched the one they were tasked to remember at the start of the trial; ‘categorization’ trials, however, were more complex. Participants had to recall a previously learnt rule that allowed them to assign the stimulus to one out of two categories based on its orientation. Crucially, categorization or maintenance trials were randomly ordered, and the categorization rule changed every nine blocks.\nFigure 1\nDownload asset\nOpen asset\nFlexible recruitment of the frontal cortex helps support working memory in rule-based recall tasks.\nThe experiments by Shao et al. aimed to explore how different brain areas are recruited in working memory processes depending on the nature of the task at hand. They involved participants observing two oriented lines and being asked to remember one of them (stimulus). First, the volunteers learned categorization rules (bottom left); depending on its orientation, a line could belong to either ‘category A’ (pink area) or ‘B’ (green area). After completing this training, the participants moved on to the trial experiments, which mixed ‘maintenance’ trials (where participants were asked which of two newly shown lines matched the one they had been asked to remember; top) with ‘categorization’ trials (which relied on the previously learned rule; bottom). In the first experiment, categorization rules switched among two possibilities after blocks of nine trials. The team recorded brain activity throughout the experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On trials with precise maintenance demands, patterns of brain activity in the visual cortex (orange), but not the superior frontal cortex (green), contained information about the stimulus orientation (top right). However, on trials with a categorization demand, both the visual and superior frontal cortex showed representations of the stimulus (bottom right). Critically, on category trials, the superior frontal cortex was most strongly correlated with behavioral performance – participants did better when more stimulus information was available in this region.\nAs the participants went through the task, Shao et al. performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure patterns of activity across their entire brain. Data analysis aimed to capture, for each trial, how strongly the stimulus was represented in three brain areas: the early visual cortex, the intraparie",
    "summary": "navigating daily life often means juggling info we can’t see anymore—like remembering parking rules on a busy street. this is thanks to working memory, which does more than just hold onto facts; it helps us reach our goals by guiding decisions and actions. new research highlights how our brains flexibly recruit different regions for working memory, depending on what we need to do.\n\nusing brain imaging, scientists found that when tasks required simple recall, the visual cortex took the lead. but when rules or categories had to be applied, the frontal cortex stepped in, adapting to the task’s demands. this flexibility shows that working memory isn’t fixed in one brain area—it shifts according to our goals and context.\n\nthese insights are reshaping neuroscience, revealing just how dynamic and adaptable our brains are when solving real-world problems. understanding this could help improve learning, memory, and even treatments for cognitive disorders.\n\n🧠✨\n\n#neuroscience #workingmemory #brainpower #cognition #research #mentalhealth"
