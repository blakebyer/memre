    "abstract": "<jats:p>Astrocytes, traditionally viewed as supportive cells within the central nervous system (CNS), are now recognized as dynamic regulators of neural signaling and homeostasis. They actively engage in synaptic transmission and brain health by releasing gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, ATP, adenosine, lactate, and <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>-serine. Astrocytes also play a critical role in ion homeostasis and immune response through cytokine modulation and reactive oxygen species regulation. In pathological states, astrocytes can become reactive, contributing to neurodegeneration through dysregulated gliotransmitter release and metabolic dysfunction. Recently developed molecular and pharmacological tools allow the exploration of astrocytic response to injury and its influence on neuronal function. This review explores the multifaceted roles of astrocytes in health and disease, emphasizing sensory and motor functions as well as various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

These star-shaped cells release gliotransmitters like glutamate and GABA, crucial for synaptic transmission. They maintain ion balance and modulate immune responses, showcasing their vital role in both health and disease. 🧠✨\n\nIn pathological states, astrocytes can become reactive, contributing to neurodegeneration. However, new molecular tools are helping us explore their response to injury and their influence on neuronal function. Understanding astrocyte-neuron interactions opens up exciting possibilities for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. 🌐🔬\n\nAs neuroscience evolves, the spotlight on astrocytes reveals their dual roles, offering fresh insights and potential therapeutic avenues.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Life on this planet is heavily influenced by light, the most critical external environmental factor. Mammals perceive environmental light mainly through three types of photoreceptors in the retina—rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). The latest discovered ipRGCs are particularly sensitive to short-wavelength light and have a unique phototransduction mechanism, compared with rods and cones. Piles of evidence suggest that ipRGCs mediate a series of light-regulated physiological functions such as circadian rhythms, sleep, metabolic homeostasis, mood, development, and higher cognitions, collectively known as non-image-forming vision. Recent advances in systems neuroscience, driven by modern neural circuit tools, have illuminated the structure and function of the neural pathways connecting the retina to subcortical regions, highlighting their involvement in an array of non-image-forming functions. Here we review key discoveries and recent progress regarding the neural circuit mechanisms employed by ipRGCs to regulate diverse biological functions and provide insights into unresolved scientific questions in this area.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social behaviors, including parental care, mating, and fighting, all depend on the hormonal milieu of an organism. Decades of work highlighted estrogen as a key hormonal controller of social behaviors, exerting its influence primarily through binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Recent technological advances in chemogenetics, optogenetics, gene editing, and transgenic model organisms have allowed for a detailed understanding of the neuronal subpopulations and circuits for estrogen action across <jats:italic>Esr1</jats:italic>-expressing interconnected brain regions. Focusing on rodent studies, in this review we examine classical and contemporary research demonstrating the multifaceted role of estrogen and ERα in regulating social behaviors in a sex-specific and context-dependent manner. We highlight gaps in knowledge, particularly a missing link in the molecular cascade that allows estrogen to exert such a diverse behavioral repertoire through the coordination of gene expression changes. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of ERα’s action in social behaviors provides insights into the broader mechanisms of hormone-driven behavior modulation across the lifespan.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Updated on April 9, 2025.</jats:p>",

Recent advances in tech like chemogenetics and optogenetics have unveiled the intricate brain circuits influenced by estrogen. While rodent studies shed light on these processes, there's still more to uncover about the molecular pathways that allow estrogen to orchestrate such diverse behaviors. Understanding these mechanisms could offer insights into hormone-driven behavior modulation throughout life. 🔬✨ #Neuroscience #Estrogen #BrainScience #Hormones #SocialBehavior",

Indeed, certain features of sensory estimation, such as Weber's law, apply to timing and sensation alike. However, from an organismal perspective, time is a derived feature of other signals, not a stimulus that can be readily transduced by sensory receptors. Its importance for biology lies in the fact that the physical world comprises a complex dynamical system. The multiscale spatiotemporal structure of sensory and internally generated signals within an organism is the informational fabric underlying its ability to control behavior. Viewed this way, temporal computations assume a more fundamental role than is implied by treating time as just another element of the experienced world. Thus, in this review we focus on temporal processing as a means of approaching the more general problem of how the nervous system produces adaptive behavior.</jats:p>",

Our question now is: must this channel lie within the brain ? Not only it need not, it usually does not; as the following argument will show. Consider the situation at the moment when the ball is in mid-air: is the right arm's developing movement now guided by messages from the left arm's centre* or from the position of the ball in the air ? The operational test (of S. 4/12 and 12/3) is decisive: let the left arm's movements remain unaltered but assume now that the position of the ball be altered, by a sharp gust say; is the right arm's movement altered? The normal player, if the ball should be affected by a gust, will at once modify his right-arm movements accordingly.

    "caption": "🔍 Delving into the brain's intricate networks, topological neuroscience is revolutionizing our understanding of neural circuits! 🧠✨ This emerging field uses advanced mathematical tools like persistent homology to explore everything from grid cells to olfactory perceptions. By making complex mathematics more accessible, researchers are unlocking new insights into how our brains function. This approach not only enhances our understanding of neural connectivity but also opens up exciting possibilities for future research and applications. Stay tuned as topology continues to shape the future of neuroscience! 🌐🔬\n\n#Neuroscience #BrainScience #Topology #Innovation #NeuralCircuits #PersistentHomology #ScienceExploration",
